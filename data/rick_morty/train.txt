Equals ?
We make 70 % of your salary for the same job !
Seize them !
Was this really the time to make that point , Summer ?
This is for you Daddy .
Oh man .
Okay .
Listen to me Morty Jr .
I gotta tell you something very important , okay ?
Killing is bad .
Bad .
You are silly , Daddy .
No , Morty Jr .
I &apos;m being serious , okay ?
You need to put your energy into something else .
I mean what about dancing ?
Would you like to learn how to dance ?
I like to dance ... on the graves of my enemies .
No , Morty Jr . !
Daddy , can I go outside ?
No , absolutely not !
But that &apos;s where all the people and the animals are .
Yeah , but you can &apos;t go out there because ...
The air is poisonous , for you !
You will die if ... You &apos;ll die instantly if you ever leave this house .
Do you hear me ?
- For real ?
- For real times a million , buddy .
So let &apos;s just stay inside ... let &apos;s try dancing .
Right ?
Look at me .
We &apos;re gonna dance .
Come on .
Join , dance with me here .
We love to dance .
Why do we love to dance ?
Because I said so !
- Nice .
- Nice .
So , what are you in for ?
Because I got a big ... you know ... penis between my legs .
What are you in for ?
The worst crime a female can commit .
Veronica Ann Bennett , I find you guilty of having bad bangs .
You ever noticed the ones with bad bangs always have three names ?
You are hereby sentenced to ... the silent treatment !
This is gonna be cake .
No !
Jackie !
Rick and Summer of earth .
For the crimes of treason against woman kind and for creating the sound of which we do not speak because it does not exist , you are hereby sentenced to ... What ?
A night on the couch ?
Death .
I hate you so much right now .
This will be the first instance of capital punishment in our society in 500 years due to our awesomeness .
So we are forced to improvise .
We placed a large boulder on that ledge .
Holly shit !
You &apos;re gonna crush us with a boulder ? !
No !
Stop interrupting !
The boulder falls onto a lever that will launch ... - Knives .
- What ? !
Just give me a gun , I &apos;ll kill myself .
Stop interrupting !
The knives will ... Fine !
You were right the first time , okay ?
The boulder crushes you .
I just didn &apos;t want to admit you were right .
- Happy ? !
- Just ignore them .
- Ignore them .
- Such an asshole .
Look , I &apos;m sorry , Summer .
I feel bad that I let you drag us into this .
I wish could have been a better grandpa to you .
And you know , for what it &apos;s worth , that is a really nice cute top , that you &apos;re wearing there .
Top ?
My top !
My top !
The same top you complimented earlier .
Look !
Look at the tag !
Read it !
It says ... Mark Jacobs .
Mark ?
Jacob ?
These are names of the penis .
Yes .
An earth man made this top .
Maybe on your planet separation of the genders is the right thing to do , but on earth , a certain percentage of males are born gay , which is why my clothes are better than all of yours .
It &apos;s true .
And sometimes the truth hurts .
But it must be accepted .
Like if I told you that you &apos;re using a wrong color foundation for your skin , and it ends at your neck making you look like a party clown .
Okay .
Ouch .
Noted .
But the fact remains if you impose Gazorpazorp &apos;s laws on earth you &apos;re no better than the men whose farts shall remain unspoken And if you think my top is cute , you cannot execute .
Very well .
Give the earth people spacecraft so they may head back to their weird planet where women are kind of equal , but not really .
Good job , Summer , and thanks girls .
You girls are really ... something , I tell you that .
You know , when we first got here - I was like ... - Give them a ship , now .
Morty Jr . !
Smoking ? !
That is not okay !
What are you gonna do , ground me ?
I can &apos;t go outside anyway !
So what ?
You could do things inside .
You could play guitar , you could masturbate ...
I don &apos;t wanna masturbate , I wanna conquer the planet !
Oh , here we go again !
Who do you think is gonna love you if you conquer the planet Morty Jr . ?
Love .
That &apos;s all you care about .
What about weapons ?
What about domination of the enemy ?
Alright , that &apos;s it , no more History Chanel !
This TV is for cartoons and video games only !
I hate video games !
You take that back !
Give it to me !
I didn &apos;t mean !
I didn &apos;t mean that !
I didn &apos;t mean to do that !
I &apos;m sorry !
I can &apos;t take this anymore !
I &apos;d rather breath poison than living another minute with you !
No !
No , no , no !
Stop !
My life has been a lie !
God is dead !
The government &apos;s lame !
Thanksgiving is about killing Indians !
Jesus wasn &apos;t born on Christmas , they moved the date , it was a pagan holiday !
- Oh , Dad !
- Yes , Morty ?
My son is gonna take over the planet , and I am too young to drive .
Can you help me get him back ?
I suppose , Morty .
I suppose .
But first a deep sip from a very tall glass of &quot; I told you so &quot; .
Oh my god , please Dad , come on !
Dad , there he is !
Oh God .
Hey stop that !
Oh my god , oh my god , Dad !
Morty Jr . , no !
It &apos;s me .
It &apos;s Dad .
It &apos;s okay .
Put the car down Morty Jr . No !
Where &apos;s your hands ?
Where &apos;s your hands ?
My car !
♪ And that &apos;s how we play handy hands .
♪ - Out of the way , Morty !
- No !
Morty , that &apos;s one of the most violently aggressive creature in the universe .
He &apos;s my son !
And if you hurt him , you have to kill me , Rick !
Dad , I &apos;m so confused .
I know Morty Jr .
I &apos;m sorry .
I ended up lying to you and yelling at you just like my parents did to me .
You know parents are just kids having kids .
One minute you like how a shiny robot looks , the next minute you &apos;re in a fist fight with your alien son .
I &apos;m an alien ?
We all have bad impulses , bad thoughts .
We just have to learn to channel them into something constructive .
But I want to murder everyone I see .
Well you know , maybe there is a job out there for people that feel that way .
Actually , there is .
Hi , I &apos;m Brad Anderson .
Creator of the nationally syndicated comic strip &quot; Marmaduke &quot; .
You should consider being a creative .
I &apos;m hunted by uncontrollable thoughts of mutilation and sexual assaults on a nearly daily basis .
But you know ?
I channeled it all into my work .
I never got that impression from reading Marmaduke .
Well , did you get the impression I was trying to make you laugh ?
Tell me that wasn &apos;t Brad Anderson .
See , you hear that , Morty Jr . ?
Maybe you could try being a creative of some kind .
Maybe ?
I always have sort of wanted to see my face on the back of a novel .
I mean what I really wanna do is slit people &apos;s throat , but , beyond that .
I know you can do it , son .
I think it &apos;s time I get a place of my own .
I promise I call you every day I need money or a place to do laundry .
So , I assume this novel your son writes is gonna pay for my rear Axel ?
Isn &apos;t it interesting Summer , that after all that stuff we just did nothing really mattered , there was no point to it .
Kind of makes you wonder , huh ?
- About nothing - Are you sure it doesn &apos;t make you re-evaluate your policy about taking girls on adventure ?
No I &apos;d say given what we &apos;ve been through , that I was right the whole time , and any epiphanies about gender politics were projection of your feminine insecurity .
But hey , why don &apos;t you have pink spaceship ?
Go ride around , and have a jolly old time .
Maybe that &apos;ll shut you up .
Dad ?
Summer ?
Where were you guys this whole time ?
On Gazorpazorp .
Where were you ?
I was reading a newspaper .
Oh , that &apos;s interesting , Beth .
You know it &apos;s funny ...
I heard about a little bit of news , myself .
Take a look .
Take a listen .
This world ... still got a ... still got a chance !
See you guys next week !
See everybody next week !
Mortimer Smith Jr . New York Times best selling author .
Your book is about innocence , the definition of it , and inevitably its impossibility .
Is it autobiographical ?
Certainly .
I mean , all writing is , in my opinion .
But , my ... My father ... kept me locked in the house until I was a teenager .
And there was violence and ... threats of poison gas .
- But also dancing .
- But you persevered and created this masterpiece from your suffering .
Smith Jr . &apos; s mind-bending novel , &quot; My Horrible Father &quot; in every store &lt; i &gt; and on everyone &apos;s mind pick it up , we &apos;ll be right back . &lt; / i &gt; It &apos;s a thankless job , Morty .
You did the best you could .
I hope he &apos;s eating enough .
- Cynthia ... - Oh , my God !
No , no ... - I told you !
- Hold on ... Will you please ... &lt; i &gt; Not &lt; / i &gt; marry me ?
I choose Veronica .
- What ?
- Yes !
- Called it .
- Why would he choose Veronica ?
Because he loves her .
Well ... if it &apos;s any consolation , Summer , none of it mattered , and the entire show is stupid .
Okay , I &apos;ve got an idea , Rick .
You show us your concept of &quot; good TV &quot; , and we &apos;ll crap all over that .
I thought you &apos;d never ask .
Hey !
Oh , cool !
Is that crystallized Zanthonite ?
It conducts electrons across dimensions .
Twenty percent accurate , as usual , Morty .
The important thing being I just upgraded our cable package with programming from every conceivable reality .
Wait , does that mean we get Showtime Extreme ?
How about Showtime Extreme in a world where man evolved from corn .
We &apos;re not so different .
We &apos;re both corn of action .
Yeah .
But one of us is ... &lt; i &gt; dead corn &lt; / i &gt; !
- Boring .
- Summer , you just spent three months , watching a man choose a fake wife .
So what ?
It &apos;d be better if the people were corn ?
Jerry , you don &apos;t get it .
This is infinite TV , from infinite universes .
Look .
This shit is delicious .
A movie about a guy eating shit .
A violent Antiques Show ... - It &apos;s a pleasure to have you .
- The pleasure &apos;s all mine .
Letterman from a time line where Jerry &apos;s famous ... - Wait !
- What in the hell ?
I agree .
Where is this going ?
No , the other thing !
Go back !
Really ?
All right , fine .
Glenn , this is a court order .
It says you can &apos;t eat shit anymore .
All right , Jerry , when you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right .
Now I &apos;m hooked .
Rick and Morty S01E08 &quot; Rixty Minutes &quot; Translated back from Portuguese by paulo loppes Corrections by TPBfan Tweaking by XhmikosR www.MY-SUBS.com Coming up next on &quot; Shmloo &apos;s the Shmloss &quot; , Shmlony has a nightmare .
Shmlantha , Schmlona !
Amazing .
A dimension where all proper nouns begin with &quot; Schmla &quot; .
Schmlove , Schmlandula , Schmlonathan ... All right , that got ... that actually got old pretty quick .
Rick , would you please go back to me on David Letterman ?
Infinity &apos;s a big number , Jerry .
I don &apos;t remember the channel .
- Go back , go back !
- Jeez ... You speak da tru-tru .
Oh my God !
Dad &apos;s in Cloud Atlas !
I &apos;m in Cloud Atlas !
What &apos;s Cloud Atlas ?
Sometimes small tru-tru different than da big tru-tru .
How is this possible ?
Infinite time lines , infinite possibilities .
Including a time line where Jerry &apos;s a movie star .
Look , you guys are getting excited about the wrong aspect of this device .
Wa ... Look at this .
And now , another Quick Mystery .
I just want to know who could &apos;ve done something like this .
It &apos;s a travesty !
I did .
See this knife and all the blood on it ?
Here &apos;s my fingerprints .
Guilty !
I sentence you to life in prison .
- Here &apos;s another &lt; i &gt; Quick Mystery &lt; / i &gt; .
- My mother &apos;s dead !
And I killed her .
Here &apos;s the weapon .
And cuff me , thank you very much .
Guilty !
Sentenced to murder .
- Here &apos;s another .
- I &apos;m the killer !
Wow , that one was really quick , wasn &apos;t it ?
Now who wants to watch random , crazy TV shows from different dimensions ... and then who wants to narcissistically obsess about their alternate self ?
- I want to obsess about myself .
- The narcisstic stuff .
Here .
These scan your retinas , and let you view parallel time lines through genetically matching versions of your eyes .
Go fetch !
- Yes !
This is so cool !
- Ladies First !
I &apos;m proud of you , Morty .
Hey man , I don &apos;t give a crap about myself , Rick .
Let &apos;s watch some crazy stuff , yo !
I &apos;m Ants-In-My-Eyes Johnson , Here at Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson &apos;s Electronics .
I mean , there &apos;s so many ants in my eyes !
And there &apos;s so many TVs , microwaves , radios ...
I think , I can &apos;t ...
I &apos;m not 100 % sure what we have here in stock , because I can &apos;t see anything .
Our prices I hope aren &apos;t too low !
Check out this refrigerator !
Only $ 200 !
What about this microwave ?
Only $ 100 !
That &apos;s fair !
I &apos;m Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson !
Everything &apos;s black , I can &apos;t see a thing !
And also I can &apos;t feel anything either , did I mention that ?
But that &apos;s not as catchy as having ants in your eyes .
So that always goes , you know , off by the wayside .
I can &apos;t feel .
It &apos;s a very rare disease .
All my ... All my nerves , they don &apos;t allow for the sensation of touch .
&lt; i &gt; So I never know what &apos;s going on .
Am I standing ?
Sitting ?
I don &apos;t know . &lt; / i &gt; Are we sure we want to do this ?
Look at our own alternate lives ?
You &apos;re right .
Maybe we should just play Yahtzee .
Give me those !
- What do you see ?
- Whiteness .
Pure whiteness .
You &apos;re my best friend , Jerry Smith .
I love doing cocaine with you .
Whoa ...
I love doing cocaine with you too , Johnny Depp !
Haven &apos;t we spent enough time on you ?
I &apos;m performing surgery ... but not on a horse , on a human !
That &apos;s great , Beth !
You always wanted to be a real surgeon .
I am a real surgeon .
- Ahh ... uh ... Summer &apos;s turn !
- Finally !
I don &apos;t see anything .
Well , you should select a different timeline , I mean , if your father and I achieved our dreams , there &apos;s a chance you weren &apos;t even born .
That came out wrong .
That came out very wrong .
Fine , I &apos;ll find a world where you bothered to have me .
We &apos;re playing Yahtzee .
- Yahtzee &apos;s fun .
We love Yahtzee .
- It &apos;s a fun game for fun families !
Hey , could I get those goggles back for a second ?
It &apos;s a 45 horsepower with anti-lock brakes , and it &apos;s the official car of Mr. Sneezy 3D .
It &apos;s the brand-new ... Sneezy XL .
The horn when you honk it makes a sneeze noise .
It &apos;s polite , it &apos;s right , and it &apos;s Sneezy ... Deezy ... Mc ... Deluxe .
Oh , I &apos;m Mr. Sneezy !
Achoo !
Huh , seems like TV from other dimensions has a somewhat looser feel to it .
Yeah , it &apos;s got an almost improvisational tone .
It &apos;s in theaters now !
Coming this summer : Two brothers .
In a van .
And then a meteor hit .
And they ran as fast as they could ... from giant cat monsters .
And then a giant tornado came ... and that &apos;s when things got knocked into 12th gear .
A Mexican armada shows up .
With weapons made from To- ... tomatoes .
And you better bet your bottom dollar ... that these two brothers know how to handle business .
In : &lt; i &gt; Alien Invasion Tomato Monster Mexican Armada Brothers &lt; / i &gt; , &lt; i &gt; Who Are Just Regular Brothers , Running In a van from an Asteroid &lt; / i &gt; ... &lt; i &gt; and All Sorts of Things &lt; / i &gt; ...
THE MOVIE !
Hold on , there &apos;s more !
Old women are coming , and they &apos;re also in the movie , and they &apos;re gonna come , and cross ... attack ... these two brothers .
But let &apos;s get back to the brothers , because they &apos;re ... they have a strong bond .
You don &apos;t want to know about it here , but I &apos;ll tell you one thing : The moon ... ... it comes crashing into Earth .
And what do you do then ?
It &apos;s two brothers and ... and th-they &apos;re ...
It &apos;s called ... Two brothers ... Two brothers !
It &apos;s just called &lt; i &gt; Two Brothers &lt; / i &gt; .
Holy crap , I am winning a Nobel Prize .
Come on !
Time &apos;s up !
I &apos;m taming a lion !
No , wait , uh ... there are film cameras .
I might be a lion-tamer in a movie .
You get the idea .
I work with lions .
Ooh , we &apos;re not playing Yahtzee , we &apos;re playing Chutes and Ladders .
It seems like when I exist , life gets a little more , I don &apos;t know ... predictable ?
When two people create a life together , they set aside their previous lives as individuals .
Gimme a break !
We &apos;re not heroes for having unprotected sex on prom night .
Oh , I get it .
Now that you know you could have had it better , you resent me for holding you back .
Now that we know you think the tables are turning , we know you thought there were unturned tables !
- What are you talking about ?
- All this time , you &apos;ve been thinking , &quot; What if that loser Jerry hadn &apos;t talked me out of the abortion ? &quot;
Well now you know , you &apos;d be a doctor .
Whoop-dee-doo .
You &apos;d also be drinking wine , alone in a house full of exotic birds .
And I &apos;d be on DiCaprio &apos;s yacht , banging Kristen Stewart !
You thought about getting an abortion ?
Everyone thinks about it .
Obviously , I &apos;m the version of me that didn &apos;t do it .
- So ... you &apos;re welcome .
- Yeah , you &apos;re welcome .
Yeah , thank you guys &lt; i &gt; so &lt; / i &gt; much .
It &apos;s a real treat to be raised by parents that force themselves to be together instead of being happy .
Hey , do we have any wafer cookies ?
Oh , boy .
Looks like you guys have been checking out alternate lives and realizing you don &apos;t have it as good , huh ?
That &apos;s too bad .
You know , me and Morty are having a blast , We just discovered a show called &quot; Ball Fondlers &quot; .
I mean , I don &apos;t want to rub it in or anything , but you guys clearly backed the wrong conceptual horse .
- I &apos;m in heaven right now .
- This might be the best day of my life .
So now what do we do ?
That show &quot; Ball Fondlers &quot; sounded kind of interesting .
- Dad !
- What ?
They &apos;re having fun in there !
What do you guys want from me ?
Every family on this block has to wonder if they &apos;re together by choice .
Our family just has inter-dimensional goggles to show us for a fact that we &apos;re not .
- We &apos;ll I &apos;m leaving !
- You can &apos;t leave , you &apos;re 17 !
Yeah , and I &apos;m not pregnant .
I &apos;m gonna have better judgment than you guys had at my age .
I &apos;m gonna ... move to the southwest and ...
I don &apos;t know , do something with turquoise .
It &apos;s Saturday Night Live !
Starring ... ... a piece of toast !
Two guys , with handle-bar mustaches !
A man painted silver who makes robot noises !
Gar Manarnar !
Three ... uh ... uh , uh , uh , I &apos;ll get back to that one ... A hole in the wall , where the men can see it all ... and returning , for his 25th consecutive year : Bobby Moynihan !
Interesting fun fact , uh , Moynihan and piece of toast hate each other .
Apparently they &apos;ve got some real creative differences .
Hey , are you tired of real doors , cluttering up your house , where you open &apos; em , and they actually go somewhere ?
And you go in another room ?
Get on down to &quot; Real Fake Doors &quot; !
That &apos;s us .
Fill a whole room up with &apos; em .

Hey , wait a minute , Rick .
I thought this was a commercial .
- What &apos;s going on ?
I mean ... - Relax , Morty .
Don &apos;t worry about it ... Let &apos;s just ... just see where this goes .
Step on it , we all got places to be !
Son of a bitch !
See , that must be where he lives ... OK . Huh .
Making himself a sandwich now ... Hey everybody !
So this is my house , I just made a sandwich , peanut butter and jelly , still here , still selling fake doors !
- What ?
- Oh , my God !
It &apos;s still the commercial !
We have fake doors ... like you wouldn &apos;t believe !
What are you worried about ?
Come get fake doors .
Call us up , and order some fake doors today .
Don &apos;t even hesitate , Don &apos;t even worry and don &apos;t even ... - All right , I &apos;m bored .
Change it .
- Wait wait , Rick !
Hold on .
Even give it a second thought .
That &apos;s our slogan .
See it on the bottom of the screen , below our name .
Here &apos;s another slogan , right below that one .
What are you worried about ?
Come get fake doors Get in here quick , get out quicker , with an arm of fake doors in you arms .
Okay , okay , you can change it .
Don &apos;t even worry about it ...
I hate Mumunmunundsdays .
And I really could go for some enchiladas .
Hey Rick , that &apos;s pretty cool !
It &apos;s just like Garfield , only instead , it &apos;s Gazorpazorpfield .
Hey , isn &apos;t Gazorpazorp where uh ... where those Sex robots came from , remember ?
That whole thing ?
Yeah ... hey , that &apos;s pretty , pretty ... that &apos;s true .
That &apos;s right !
Yeah .
Let &apos;s watch some more Gazorpazorpfield !
Hey Jon , it &apos;s me , Gazorpazorpfield .
Boy .
&#91; BLEEP &#93; you , Jon .
You &#91; BLEEP &#93; dumb , stupid , idiot .
Come on , Gazorpazorpfield , go easy on me , huh ?
You dumb , stupid , weak , pathetic , white , white ... uh , uh ... ... guilt , white guilt , milquetoast piece of human garbage .
Jeez , Gazorpazorpfield , thats , you know ... you &apos;re pretty mean to me , but that takes the cake .
I don &apos;t give a &#91; BLEEP &#93; !
I &apos;m Gazorpazorp- &#91; BLEEP &#93; -field , bitch !
Now give me my &#91; BLEEP &#93; enchiladas !
Hey , Rick , you know , did they use Bill Murray for this ?
Sounds a lot like Bill Murray .
No , Morty , it &apos;s Lorenzo Music .
In this reality , he &apos;s still alive .
Oh , okay , was his name Lorenzo Music ?
Yeah , I &apos;m pretty sure .
He also did that voice of that one guy from Ghostbusters .
Which is really strange , because it &apos;s the same character Bill Murray played in the movie .
But then , when they made the movie ... Bill Murray did the voice of Gazorpazorp ... or Garfield , I mean .
Yeah , that &apos;s pretty cool , Rick .
So all that happened in this reality too ?
I don &apos;t know .
Just making conversation with you , Morty .
What do you think ?
I-I-I-I know everything about everything ?
Did you really talk me out of the abortion ?
Well , we ... we blew a tire on the way to the clinic .
I think , in my head , I was doing it all for the kids .
And now the first kid is going to do something with turquoise .
What is either code for crystal meth , or a gateway to it .
So we didn &apos;t do the kids any favors .
So , we should stay together for each other and ourselves , or ... Or ?
Man .
Woman .
And now trunk men ?
We know science has created men that have a trunk that allows them to have sex with both male and female partners .
But we &lt; i &gt; don &apos;t &lt; / i &gt; like the idea of these people getting married .
Put a line in the sand everybody-- , people !
Vote no on proposition XW2 .
The act that says that gay ... uh ... trunk people can get married .
Who needs it ?
Not on my watch !
Paid for by Michael Dennys and The Denny Singers .
Hi , I &apos;m a trunk person .
And I want ... I-I feel love in my heart , too , just like you .
I want to be able to express that love , with both a man and a woman .
And I won &apos;t be able to ...
If Denny and The Denny Singers get their way .
Hey , let the trunk people have sex and get married , huh ?
Paid for by ... Trunk People .
Oh , I love me Strawberry Smiggles !
Ooh , I hope nobody ever gets my hands on me , and tries to steal my Strawberry Smiggles .
I &apos;m going to eat every last one of them , because ... and then they &apos;ll be in my stomach , and nobody will ever be able to eat them .
Except for me , because they &apos;re going to be all inside my stomach .
I &apos;m ... my name is Mister ... Top Hat Jones , and God forbid anyone ever take my sniggy , little pig-dul ... smiggles .
I &apos;m keeping &apos; em all for me .
Last bite .
Oh , now they are all resting comfortably in my stomach .
Ooh , am I feeling good .
No !
Get away from me !
Get away from me and my Strawberry Smiggles !
No !
Jesus Christ !
Jesus Christ !
It hurts !
My entrails are out !
Why would you even want to eat these ?
They &apos;re soaked with my stomach acid !
Oh , Jesus Christ !
Lord and savior and spirit !
Save me !
Take me to the light !
Oh , my God , I see Demons !
I see demons are coming !
Jeez , Rick .
Oh my god !
That &apos;s some pretty hardcore stuff , you know , for a cereal commercial .
Well , you know , Morty , I mean , you want to sell boxes of cereal , you gotta , you gotta , pump the gas a little .
Pedal to the metal , Morty .
&lt; i &gt; In a world , where muscular mannies , are coming , and they &apos;re coming strong , &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; there &apos;s only three ... unmuscular ... Michaels . &lt; / i &gt; Get down !
Hurry , run !
&lt; i &gt; And that &apos;s when real turbulent juice is coming , &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; and you gotta take care of it . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; With turbulent juice , Turmulent tables . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; No room is safe from the turbulent power of turbulent juice . &lt; / i &gt; - What in the hell ?
- Sex sells , Morty .
Sex sells what ?
Was that a movie , or like , does it clean stuff ?
Hey , Dad .
W-w-what &apos;s going on ?
Oh , your mother and I are going to be spending some time apart , Morty .
And your sister found out she was an unwanted pregnancy .
W-w-w-what ?
Speaking of &quot; w-w-what &quot; , Morty ... W-w-what should we watch next ?
What about this ?
Baby Legs , you &apos;re a good detective ... but not good enough , because of your baby legs .
So I &apos;m partnering you up with Regular Legs .
- Hey there .
- Detective , I &apos;m ... this is upsetting to me , because I feel like I don &apos;t need no regular-leg partner .
Baby Legs , don &apos;t talk back to me .
Good luck you two , there &apos;s a criminal to kill .
Wow , you sure found this guy quick !
Uh , yeah , because I &apos;m a good detective .
Look , Baby Legs , it &apos;s the criminal !
&#91; BLEEP &#93; , I &apos;m the killer .
I &apos;m running , running real quick ... Baby Legs , here we go !
That &apos;s the sound I make , when I &apos;m trying to run fast .
All right , I &apos;m not going to get him .
I &apos;m , I-I just learned a real valuable lesson .
I &apos;m coming , Baby Legs !
I &apos;m ...
Regular Legs !
- We got him !
- Hey , that was good team work .
Baby Legs , and Regular Legs , I &apos;m proud of you two for working together , and Baby Legs , I know it was hard for you to come to the conclusion that you need a partner .
- But I &apos;m proud of you that you did it .
- Hey thanks , chief !
Now get the &#91; BLEEP &#93; out of here !
Pretty cool , huh , Morty ?
Oh .
Uh , I thought it was cool .
I don &apos;t give a &#91; BLEEP &#93; what you think , Jerry .
Hey , uh ... Y-Y-Y-You doin &apos; okay ?
I-I-I kind of know how you feel , Summer .
No , you don &apos;t .
You &apos;re the little brother .
You &apos;re not the cause of your parents &apos; misery .
You &apos;re just a symptom of it .
- Can I show you something ?
- Morty , no offense , but a drawing of me you made when you were 8 isn &apos;t gonna make make me feel like less of an accident .
That , out there ?
That &apos;s my grave .
Wait , what ?
On one of our adventures , Rick and I basically destroyed the whole world .
So we bailed on that reality , and we came to this one .
Because in this one , the world wasn &apos;t destroyed .
And in this one , we were dead .
So we came here , a-a-and we buried ourselves , and we took their place .
And every morning , Summer , I eat breakfast , 20 yards away from my own rotting corpse .
So , you &apos;re not my brother ?
I &apos;m better than your brother .
I &apos;m a version of your brother you can trust when he says , &quot; Don &apos;t run &quot; .
Nobody exists on purpose , nobody belongs anywhere ... ... everybody &apos;s gonna die .
Come watch TV .
&lt; i &gt; Mrs.
Sullivan always planned to leave everything to her cats . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; But sometimes , plans need a helping paw . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; What are the kitties to do , but buckle together and work as a team . &lt; / i &gt; Mrs. Sullivan , I , uh ... please forgive me for being forward .
But your eyes are so beautiful !
Wait , this is an actual movie ?
&lt; i &gt; This fall ... sparks will fly ! &lt; / i &gt; Mrs ... Oh ... Sullivan ... &lt; i &gt; Between one guy , who can &apos;t get a break ... &lt; / i &gt; There &apos;s something about you , Mrs. Sullivan .
&lt; i &gt; ... and 9 cats who break all the rules . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Last Will and Testa-meow : Weekend at Dead Cat Lady &apos;s House 2 . &lt; / i &gt; Well , somebody in Hollywood just lost their job .
&lt; i &gt; Written and directed by Jerry Smith . &lt; / i &gt; I wrote &lt; i &gt; and &lt; / i &gt; directed that ?
What am I , nuts ?
Hey Morty , you just missed a preview for your Dad &apos;s &quot; Citizen Kane &quot; .
Doesn &apos;t matter .
Hey , if your , uh , mother and I had to split custody ... - ... who would you guys choose ?
- Doesn &apos;t matter .
&lt; i &gt; Breaking News : Academy Award-winning actor Jerry Smith &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; is leading police on a slow-speed pursuit &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; after suffering an apparent breakdown . &lt; / i &gt; - Don &apos;t even think about it .
- Come on , Jer- Are you kidding me , Jerry ?
It &apos;s just a bunch of dumb tabloid crap .
It &apos;s my life , and we &apos;re watching it .
You did it , Beth .
You really nailed it .
You &apos;re a surgeon .
A human surgeon .
Yay ... you win .
Where the hell am I going ?
What are you asking me for Jerry ?
I &apos;m sitting here trying to figure out why the cops don &apos;t just take you out .
They got a clear shot to your head .
I can &apos;t believe our tax dollars pay for this .
Jerry ?
Jerry Smith ?
Beth Sanchez , I have been in love with you since high school .
I hate acting , I hate cocaine , I hate Kristen Stewart .
I wish you hadn &apos;t gotten that abortion , and I never stopped thinking about what might &apos;ve been .
Hey , Ball Fondlers ?
Huh ?
Ball Fondlers ?
- Yeah , I could go for some Ball Fondlers .
- Yeah , Ball Fondlers .
Ha-ha , Hamster-in-Butt-World Weather is done , and now it &apos;s sports time , coming up .
- Oh , hello there !
- Good day to you , Miss .
So the hamsters live inside the rectums of those people ?
Yeah , sweetie , that &apos;s where they live .
Well , how does that work ?
I mean , do the butts look like little apartments inside ?
Yeah !
And can they like , leave the butt , and walk around on their own ?
Look , I don &apos;t know !
I &apos;m watching the same thing you guys are .
Grandpa Rick , if they leave the butt , and the person wanders off ... How would they find their butt person again ?
I don &apos;t know , Summer !
I can &apos;t even hear the TV !
All right , that &apos;s it .
We &apos;re just gonna go there , so you idiots can ask your stupid questions all day .
Ooh !
Family vacation !
Hey , Rick .
I have to make a project for the science fair this weekend .
- You think you could help me out ?
- Whatever .
Well , I mean , traditionally , science fairs are a father-son thing .
Well , scientifically , traditions are an idiot thing .
Morty , I think it would be fun for you to work on a science project with your dad .
Uh ... Yeah , dad .
Why don &apos;t we do it together ?
Yes !
You backed the right horse on this one , son .
We &apos;ll get out the crayons , brew some coffee , and knock this thing out in two or three days .
&lt; i &gt; - What is my purpose ? &lt; / i &gt; - Pass the butter .
Thank you .
Dad , I need a ride to work .
Maybe Rick can give you a ride .
I &apos;m helping Morty with science .
I &apos;m busy .
Doing what ?
Uh , anything else .
&lt; i &gt; - What is my purpose ? &lt; / i &gt; - You pass butter .
&lt; i &gt; Oh , my god . &lt; / i &gt; Yeah , welcome to the club , pal .
Corrections by XhmikosR www.MY-SUBS.com - Since when do &lt; i &gt; you &lt; / i &gt; have a job ?
- Since last week .
It &apos;s part-time at this little vintage thrift store .
My boss is this really smart , eccentric old man that treats me nice and values me .
Meow .
Can &apos;t wait to meet this fascinating character .
Please don &apos;t .
Oh .
Well , when did this stop being Jamba Juice ?
I &apos;ve just recently opened for business , mister , um , Goldenfold .
You know my name ?
That &apos;s disarming .
I also know you long for female company .
You know , it &lt; i &gt; has &lt; / i &gt; been lonely since the divorce .
Some voids can &apos;t be filled with Jamba Juice .
This aftershave makes a man quite irresistible to women .
Free of charge .
One never pays here-- not with money .
Nothing to read into there .
Thanks !
Sorry I &apos;m late , mr . Needful .
This is my grandpa , Rick .
He was just leaving .
Huh .
Tell me , Rick , what do &lt; i &gt; you desire &lt; / i &gt; ?
Eh , I make my own stuff .
So , what are you-- like , the devil ?
- What ?
Sorry ?
- I don &apos;t know .
Store comes out of nowhere , all the shit &apos;s old and creepy .
Are you the devil ?
A demon ?
- Leprechaun ?
- Grandpa Rick !
Hey , I &apos;m not judging .
Just like shoot straight .
I &apos;m a man of science .
Ah , then perhaps you could make use of this .
This microscope reveals things beyond comprehension .
Grandpa , go home and drink .
Why don &apos;t we do a model of the solar system ?
That &apos;s what my dad did with me when I was your age .
Oh , okay .
You know , Rick &apos;s in his lab , making cyborgs and wormholes and all that weird stuff , but this is real science .
A man and his boy , making planets .
Hey , how about we use a ping-pong ball for Pluto ?
And then Jupiter -- Uh , actually , I don &apos;t think Pluto &apos;s a planet .
Of course Pluto &apos;s a planet , son .
I learned that in the third grade .
Well , yeah , but you know they changed it .
Morty , nobody changed the planets .
I just googled it .
Pluto &apos;s not a planet .
They changed it in 2006 .
Yeah , I heard about that , Morty .
- And I disagree .
- You disagree ?
That &apos;s right .
It &apos;s possible to disagree in science , Morty .
Pluto was a planet .
Some committee of fancy assholes disagree .
I disagree back .
Give me a ping-pong ball .
Um , okay .
I-I just have to ... Go find Rick and go over my head about Pluto ?
No .
Geez , I just got to go to the bathroom .
Damn .
Oh .
Okay , good .
This is gonna be fun .
Hey , Morty , let me ask you a question real quick .
Does evil exist , and if so , can one detect and measure it ?
Um ...
Rhetorical question , Morty .
The answer &apos;s &quot; yes , you just have to be a genius &quot; .
Cute .
Your sister &apos;s boss gave me a microscope that would have made me retarded .
Ooh .
Oh , boy , Rick .
I &apos;m don &apos;t think you &apos;re allowed to say that word , you know ?
Morty , I &apos;m not disparaging the differently abled .
I &apos;m stating the fact that if I had used this microscope , it would have made me mentally retarded .
Okay , yeah , but I don &apos;t think it &apos;s about logic , Rick .
I think the word has just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups that feel like they &apos;re doing the right thing .
Well , that &apos;s retarded .
What are you guys talking about ?
Apparently , nothing .
You asked him if Pluto &apos;s a planet , didn &apos;t you ?
- No !
- It &apos;s not .
- Shut up , Rick .
- Whoa .
I don &apos;t care what anyone says .
If it &lt; i &gt; can &lt; / i &gt; be a planet , it can be a planet &lt; i &gt; again &lt; / i &gt; .
&lt; i &gt; Planet &lt; / i &gt; .
Planet , planet , planet .
Stay scientific , Jerry .
This aftershave made women want me , but it also made me impotent !
A price for everything , mr . Goldenfold .
A price for everything .
Oh , my God !
How could I not see this coming ? !
My lust !
My greed !
I deserved this !
I deserved this !
This serum should counteract the negative effects .
Holy cats !
Ladies , let &apos;s get out of here .
I haven &apos;t learned a thing !
Here .
You can have this back .
You didn &apos;t use it ?
Sure I did -- to develop this .
It detects and catalogs all your &quot; twilight zone &quot; , &quot; ray bradbury &quot; , &quot; Friday the 13th &quot; the series voodoo crap magic .
I thought you might want it so you didn &apos;t accidentally sell anybody , say ... A typewriter that generates best-selling murder mysteries and then makes the murders happen in real life ?
- Ooh .
- Be quiet .
Don &apos;t you want to make sure people know what they &apos;re getting ?
You &apos;re not intentionally selling ... beauty cream that makes ugly ladies pretty but also makes them blind ?
I find this all quite preposterous .
Oh , I say , good sir .
Oh , harrumph .
Oh , oh Oh , oh that &apos;s beautiful .
You know it &apos;s gonna be wearing you in three hours ?
Do I need to call the police ?
Here , you can use my phone .
Don &apos;t worry .
It won &apos;t make you deaf because I &apos;m not a hack .
You think you &apos;re so great , you stupid piece of shit .
Stop !
Hey !
&#91; Beep &#93; you , man .
Stop it right now !
Grandpa Rick , I like working here .
You work for the devil .
So what ?
&quot; So what ? &quot;
Yes , so what if he &apos;s the devil , Rick ?
At least the devil has a job .
At least he &apos;s active in the community .
What do you do ?
You eat our food and make gadgets .
Buh-bye .
Whoops .
I &apos;m sorry , mr . Needful .
I &apos;ll clean that up .
I don &apos;t know what I can do about the ghost lady that came out of it , but -- It &apos;s fine .
Summer , you know , your grandfather &apos;s right .
This store curses people .
That &apos;s my business .
Well , yeah .
Fast-food gives people diabetes , and clothing stores have sweatshops .
Is there a company hiring teenagers that &lt; i &gt; isn &apos;t &lt; / i &gt; evil ?
This is my first job .
You &apos;ve been nice to me , mr . Needful .
You respect me .
Please , call me &quot; the devil &quot; .
I &apos;d rather not , actually .
Yes , perhaps not during business hours .
I told you , I want to file a declaration that Pluto is a planet .
Well , then my son &apos;s going to fail his science class , and when that happens , I &apos;m suing you first .
I think I know what the &quot; a &quot; in NASA stands for .
Dad , what &apos;s your endgame ?
Ain &apos;t no game , sucka .
Why don &apos;t we just make the solar system with eight planets ?
It &apos;s even easier .
Sure , sure , and why don &apos;t we just burn Galileo at the stake for saying the sun is round ?
Science isn &apos;t always easy , Morty .
- Whoa !
- Whoa !
What the hell ? !
I &apos;m king Flippy Nips , ruler of Pluto .
We discovered you quite by accident during routine surveillance of your world .
You really gave it to those guys at NASA .
I was -- you know , sometimes science is about conviction .
I &apos;d like to introduce you to a few people that very much agree with you .
Oh , I ... Plutonians .
Jerry Smith is a scientist from earth , where he &apos;s creating a model of our solar system .
Jerry , tell Pluto about your decision .
Um ... Pluto &apos;s a planet .
Pluto &apos;s a &#91; beep &#93; planet , bitch !
Oh , man .
This is definitely gonna go to his head .
If it &apos;s athletic prowess you desire , principle vagina , I might -- - I &apos;ll take it .
- But I haven &apos;t even -- Thank you very , very much .
Great store .
Great place .
Bye .
Huh .
Okay .
I must say , summer , I thought your grandfather &apos;s outburst would have disrupted business , but this is the best weekend I &apos;ve had since salem .
Nice .
- &quot; Wholesome delight &quot; for lunch ?
- Is that the vegan place ?
- Yeah , I love their soup .
- I &apos;m kind of soup-ed out .
Mrs. Tate , is it ?
What do you desire ?
Whoa , whoa , slow down , honey .
Oh , is there a limit ?
Everything &apos;s free , right ?
Let &apos;s just say you don &apos;t pay ... with money .
That was perfect .
You pay with the curses , right ?
Um ...
I -- well ...
But , mrs . Tate , why do you want cursed items ?
Well , I &apos;m going to get the curses removed at &quot; Curse Purge Plus &quot; .
You know , the guy on TV ?
What ?
&lt; i &gt; Have you acquired creepy specific old stuff from &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; a mysterious antique or thrift store that gives you powers but &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; &#91; beep &#93; with you in unforeseeable ways ? &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Bring it to &quot; Curse Purge Plus &quot; . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; I use science to un-curse the items for cash , &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; and you get to keep the powers . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; This guy got mysterious &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; sneakers to make him run faster , but guess what ? &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; He would have had to run until he died , making them worthless . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; I removed the curse , making &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; them worth , like , I don &apos;t know , $ 8 million . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; See you at the olympics . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; This eerily intelligent doll was threatening to murder its family . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Now it does their taxes . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Everything &apos;s deductible . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Don &apos;t pay for cool stuff with your soul . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Pay for it with money . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; You know , like how every other store in the world works ? &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; We &apos;re located at First and Main in old town . &lt; / i &gt; Come on -- come on down .
&quot; First and ... &quot; That &apos;s right across the street from &quot; Needful Things , &quot; where you can get evil items for free !
Diabolic son of a motherf-- We &apos;re back on &quot; Good morning , Pluto . &quot;
And a very good morning it is for our guest , earth scientist Jerry Smith , who &apos;s making headlines with his bold announcement that is what , Jerry ?
Pluto is a planet .
- Well , how about that .
- I love it .
Morty Smith .
I &apos;m Scroopy Noopers .
I &apos;m a scientist .
- Can I show you something ?
- Uh , I better not .
Right now .
The center of Pluto , mr . Smith , is made of a substance called &quot; Plutonium &quot; .
Mines like these suck Plutonium up to the cities , where corporations use it to power everything , from diamond cars to golden showers .
And the more we remove , the more Pluto shrinks .
There it goes again .
Just shrank a little .
But a few years ago , your scientists noticed Pluto had gotten so small they couldn &apos;t even call it a &quot; planet &quot; anymore .
Should &apos;ve been our wake-up call .
But the rich Plutonians won &apos;t wake up , and they love your dad telling everyone Pluto &apos;s a planet because that means they can keep mining until Pluto goes from planet to asteroid to meteor , and finally ... Um , a party ?
Is everyone in your family an idiot ?
Well , for sure me and my dad are .
Well , all you have to do is get him to admit that , and you could save four billion lives .
Yeah , you know , the thing is my dad &apos;s &lt; i &gt; really &lt; / i &gt; insecure .
Hmm .
Funny .
Mr. Needful , out of everything in the store , you &apos;ll never guess what we couldn &apos;t get rid of .
Oh , my god .
Oh , my god .
I wish this desk was lighter .
I wish this knot was looser .
Come on .
I don &apos;t -- Wait , what am I doing ?
I wish I knew CPR .
1 , 2 , 3 .
Oh , Jesus .
What a waste of a monkey paw .
Mr. Needful , how could you even think of doing something so horrible ?
I &apos;m the devil .
What should I do when I fail -- get myself an ice cream ?
You haven &apos;t failed .
People like Rick are making me obsolete .
I mean , seriously .
I may be &quot; the devil &quot; , but your grandpa is the devil .
I just want to go back to hell , where everyone thinks I &apos;m smart and funny .
No !
It &apos;s not fair .
Everyone in this town got something they wanted from you -- even Rick .
I was your only friend , and I get nothing ?
Okay .
I &apos;ll give you one thing .
- Name it .
- I want to help you .
Clever twist .
I learned from the best , you old fart .
Now , let &apos;s go get you hydrated .
Looks like we &apos;ve got ... haunted boxing gloves that will make you the heavyweight champion in 1936 , and then you &apos;ll be trapped there , winning the same fight for eternity .
I can take out the &quot; eternity &quot; and the padding , and then you &apos;ll have some time-traveling mittens .
Oh , look , it &apos;s Rosemary &apos;s baby .
- How &apos;s business ?
- Here &apos;s the last of our inventory .
We &apos;re going to file chapter 11 and do some restructuring .
Sounds like code for &quot; you win , Rick . &quot;
That was important to you , wasn &apos;t it ?
Nope .
It was important to your dumb devil friend .
To me , this was all just a bit , like when bugs bunny &#91; beep &#93; with the opera singer for 20 minutes .
He tried to kill himself .
Seriously ?
Holy crap .
Holy crap .
But you know what , grandpa Rick ?
He &apos;s strong , and he &apos;s never going to give up .
Uh-huh , yeah , I don &apos;t care .
Oh , I know .
Everyone knows you don &apos;t care .
So ?
So have fun not caring .
- I always do .
- Good .
Yeah , it is good .
It &apos;s the best .
I &apos;m sure it is .
- Bye .
- Later .
I &apos;m here to pick up my undead cat and child .
Yeah , uh ... Give me a sec .
These are the forms for the employee health plan .
All right , yeah , put -- put them on my ... Eh .
I just got bored .
Everybody out .
All right , just one more rally , then I promise we &apos;ll get back to your science project .
Dad , Pluto isn &apos;t a planet .
It &apos;s shrinking because of corporations .
Yeah , that &apos;s what that anti-planet nut job Scroopy Noopers was screaming about outside the ministry of money &apos;s fundraiser .
Are you telling me four billion Plutonians are wrong ?
You said science wasn &apos;t easy .
I said science isn &apos;t always easy .
Obviously , that means sometimes it &lt; i &gt; is &lt; / i &gt; easy .
Let &apos;s not debase ourselves with word games , son .
Dad , their whole planet is dying .
Ha !
You called it a planet .
Checkmate .
What &apos;s up , Pluto ?
Mr. Smith , please tell my friend here what you just told me .
Go on .
My very eager mother just served us nine pickles , and the &quot; pickles &quot; is Pluto .
My god , the man &apos;s a genius .
Um , excuse me .
Morty , what ?
Dad , what did you think about the recent report published by the Pluto science reader linking Pluto-quakes , sinkholes , and surface shrinkage to deep-core Plutonium drilling ?
Well , son , what did you think when you were 5 and you pooped your pants , and you threw your poopy undies out your bedroom window because you thought it was like throwing something in the garbage ?
I mean , I &apos;m trimming the hedges , and these things are just hanging there .
Was I supposed to think the poop bunny left them ?
Good one , dad .
Hey , Morty , you want to go on a ... Oh .
Hey , Beth .
Hello ?
Hey , Jerry , you in here being stupid ?
Thanks .
Hey , you know , I was thinking , you know , I might watch a movie .
&lt; i &gt; I am not programmed for friendship . &lt; / i &gt; Suit yourself .
Hey .
Hey .
W-w-what &apos;s going on ?
Um , listen , can you help me do the stupid science fair project ?
Whatever .
Jerry , you must be so excited .
The Pluto-bel prize is the highest honor a scientist can receive .
I &apos;m flattered and humbled .
Oh , I like that .
Use that in your speech .
Also , talk about Pluto being a planet .
People like that .
Your highness , we &apos;ve captured Scroopy Noopers .
You animals !
Animals !
Ooh , look who &apos;s little journey &apos;s come to an end .
Take him to Pluto-namo bay .
You can &apos;t kill the truth , father .
What ?
I can see you &apos;re confused .
Pluto-namo bay is a military prison-- a sort of play on words .
Did he call you &quot; father &quot; ?
Scroopy Noopers , the anti-planet nut job , is your son ?
The young eat the old if you let them , Jerry .
Pluto is a cold , cold celestial dwarf .
It &apos;s a what ?
Huh ?
Oh , planet .
&quot; Pluto is a cold , cold planet &quot; .
That &apos;s what I meant .
Knock them dead out there , you .
Pluto is ... ... Not a planet .
Ow !
It &apos;s not a planet .
Hey !
It &apos;s not a planet !
I &apos;m an idiot , and I love my son .
It was a long six hours , but we &apos;ve overhauled &quot; Needful Things &quot; into the globally-compliant web 4.0 , &quot; e-nomenon &quot; , &quot; n33dful.com &quot; , spelled with threes instead of &quot; e &quot; &apos; s .
- Whoo , yeah !
- Whoo , excited !
Okay , that &apos;s it .
We just got bought by Google !
Mm .
I &apos;m so proud of you , Lucius .
So , how much did we make ?
&quot; We &quot; .
This is &lt; i &gt; my &lt; / i &gt; business .
Security !
You &apos;re Zuckerberg-ing me ?
I was Zuckerberg-ing people before Zuckerberg &apos;s balls dropped .
I &apos;m the devil , bitch !
What , what ? !
Hey !
Hey !
- Hey , Morty .
- Oh , oh , hey , dad .
Um , what -- what are you doing back from Pluto so quick ?
Uh ...
Some people just can &apos;t handle the truth .
Especially dummies like me .
Morty , I &apos;m not as smart as your grandpa Rick , but I promise never to make that your problem again .
Hey , dad .
Nobody &apos;s smarter than Rick , but nobody else is my dad .
You &apos;re a genius at that .
Wow .
That &apos;s ... humbling and flattering , son .
Thank you .
What say we finish ourselves an eight-planet solar system ?
Um ...
I &apos;m just gonna take this thing in and get an &quot; A &quot; .
&lt; i &gt; Butter . &lt; / i &gt; But ... You &apos;re a genius at being my dad , dad .
Quit while you &apos;re ahead .
And also , knock next time , you know ?
I mean , I &apos;m sitting in here , I &apos;m 14 -- I got a computer in here , you know ?
Oh , I -- I think I understand .
You &apos;re really playing with fire when you burst in here like that , man .
I get it .
Say no more .
I mean , one of these days , you know , you &apos;re gonna end up seeing something .
I got it !
Noted .
Good night .
How &apos;s your pretend grandpa doing , aka &quot; the devil &quot; ?
He dumped me .
Oof .
Sorry .
Did we learn a lesson here I &apos;m not seeing ?
Not sure .
Maybe in a much bigger way , mr . Needful gave us both what we really wanted ?
Because I was always jealous of you hanging out with Morty , and you didn &apos;t realize how much you valued my approval ?
- No , that &apos;s dumb .
- Yeah , not satisfying .
I &apos;ll tell you what , though .
If -- if -- if it &apos;s satisfaction you &apos;re after , I think I might have an idea .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh , totally .

No .
- Well , it ... might be .
- It is .
Fine .
But also , tomorrow is your one-year anniversary back in our lives .
I &apos;m gonna make you flying-saucer-shaped pancakes .
Oh , t-t-there &apos;s no need to do that , Beth .
Regular pancakes are fine .
Oh , my God !
Oh , what is happening ? !
Sync &amp; corrections by XhmikosR www.MY-SUBS.com - Happy anniversary , dad .
- Oh , I get it .
Regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers .
I-I should be making &lt; i &gt; you &lt; / i &gt; breakfast for putting up with &lt; i &gt; me &lt; / i &gt; .
&lt; i &gt; You &lt; / i &gt; should be making us a whole restaurant .
Nonsense .
We couldn &apos;t be happier to have you around .
I just wish I got to see more of you .
Rick Sanchez of earth dimension C-137 , you are under arrest for crimes against alternate Ricks by the authority of the trans-dimensional council of Ricks .
- Hey !
What the heck ? !
- Neutralize the Jerry .
Wait !
No !
I &apos;ll -- Dad !
- Dad !
- Rick !
Everybody , relax .
If I know these a-holes , and I am these a-holes , they just want to haul me to their stupid clubhouse and waste my time with a bunch of questions .
Let &apos;s get it over with .
Bring his Morty .
- Oh , man .
- Leave my Morty out of this .
You lost the right to have a say in these things when you refused to j-- join the council .
W-w-w-what about Jerry ?
Will you at least unfreeze my daughter &apos;s idiot ?
... Give you anything !
I have a rare antique-coin collection !
Just don &apos;t hurt me !
Okay , maybe not antique , but it was a limited minting .
They have little R2-D2s instead of George Washington .
- Our son &apos;s been abducted !
- You hate me for buying those coins !
- Geez , Rick , w-what is this place ?
- The citadel of Ricks .
It &apos;s the secret headquarters for the council of Ricks .
Council of Ricks ?
As you know , Morty , I &apos;ve got a lot of enemies in the universe that consider my genius a threat -- galactic terrorists , a few sub-galactic dictators , most of the entire intergalactic government .
Wherever you find people with heads up their asses , someone wants a piece of your grandpa , and a lot of versions of me on different timelines had the same problem , so a few thousand versions of me had the ingenious idea of banding together like a herd of cattle or a school of fish or those people who answer questions on yahoo !
Answers .
Hey !
What do you know ?
It &apos;s a cowboy version of me .
Geez , you &apos;re easy to impress .
Yeah , most timelines have a Rick , and most Ricks have a Morty .
This place is a real who &apos;s who of who &apos;s you and me .
Turn your boring , old Morty into a-- hot fashion statement with some Morty dazzlers .
Hey , check this out .
&lt; i &gt; Show me the Morty . &lt; / i &gt; Dumb .
Excuse me , sir , is your Morty insured ?
You know , every year , hundreds of Mortys are injured -- Back off !
Not my cup of tea , this place .
I say the point of being a Rick is being a Rick .
Save your anti-Rick speech for the council of Ricks , terror-Rick .
Hey , save your Rick rules for the sheep-Ricks , Rick-pig .
- &#91; beep &#93; me , pal .
- &#91; beep &#93; &lt; i &gt; you &lt; / i &gt; ?
No , no , no , no , no .
&#91; beep &#93; &lt; i &gt; me &lt; / i &gt; .
Bring up the holograms .
27 Ricks brutally murdered in their own timelines-- an unprecedented Rick-icidal epidemic .
What say you , earth Rick C-137 ?
You think I did this ?
Why am I the first Rick you pull in every time a Rick stubs his toe ?
You have a history of non-cooperation with the council .
Yeah , so does the scientist formerly known as Rick .
W-w-w-w-w-why isn &apos;t &lt; i &gt; he &lt; / i &gt; here in handcuffs ?
Because &lt; i &gt; he &apos;s &lt; / i &gt; dead , too !
Who else would you have us question ?
You fit the profile .
Of all the Ricks in the central finite curve , you &apos;re the malcontent , the rogue .
I &apos;m the Rick , and so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance .
You wanted to be safe from the government , so you became a stupid government .
That makes every Rick here less Rick than me .
Yeah , murmur it up , d-bags .
Now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , I &apos;ve got pancakes back home with syrup on top of them .
They &apos;re about to hit that critical point of syrup absorption that turns the cakes into a gross paste , and I hate to get all Andy Rooney about it , but I think we all like Fluffy disks of cake with syrup on top , and I think we also like to be accused of crimes when there &apos;s evidence !
So , as they say in Canada , peace oot !
Evidence !
Good idea .
Scan his portal gun !
Oh , come on .
Don &apos;t look at another man &apos;s portal-gun history .
We -- we all go to weird places .
Yes , but it appears you alone have been going to the exact timelines and locations in which the murders occurred .
What ? !
That &apos;s Rick-diculous !
I &apos;m obviously being set up .
Earth Rick C-137 , the council of Ricks sentences you to the machine of unspeakable doom , which swaps your conscious and unconscious minds , rendering your fantasies pointless while everything you &apos;ve known becomes impossible to grasp .
Also , every 10 seconds , it stabs your balls .
I &apos;ve heard enough .
Run , Morty !
Unh-unh .
Not you .
Aaaah !
No !
Oh !
Oh !
Yeah , I &apos;d like to order one large person with extra people , please .
White people .
No , no , no , no .
Black people .
And hispanic on half .
Yes , I &apos;d like to order one large sofa chair with extra chair , please .
High chair .
No , no , no , no .
Recliner .
And wheelchair on half .
They could have gone into any one of these .
- Son of a ... - Oh , geez .
- Oh , man !
- We lost &apos; em .
Yeah , I &apos;d like to order one large phone with extra phones , please .
Cellphone .
No , no , no , no .
Rotary .
And pay phone on half .
That &apos;ll keep &apos; em busy for a while .
Those guys were wrong , right ?
Y-y-y-you-- you wouldn &apos;t kill yourself -- yourselves .
Of course not , Morty .
How could that profit me ?
But someone out there &lt; i &gt; is &lt; / i &gt; killing Ricks , and the council ain &apos;t gonna stop thinking it &apos;s me until we clear our names -- by finding the real Rick-killer .
I &apos;m scared , Rick .
Maybe we should go home and stockpile weapons , like that show &quot; doomsday preppers &quot; .
Not really my style , Morty .
Besides , your home is most likely swarming with Ricks by now .
All right , listen , Jerry .
If Rick calls , this device is gonna trace his location .
You just got to keep him on the phone for 30 seconds or longer .
Who wants lemonade ?
Oh , yeah .
Mmm !
Oh !
Delicious !
Beth you &apos;re a treasure .
I have a Beth just like you in my reality , except you know what ?
She &apos;s not as brilliant or attractive .
Aw .
Thank you .
Oh !
She did !
She did it !
H-hello ?
- &lt; i &gt; Hey , Jerry , it &apos;s Rick . &lt; / i &gt; - Rick !
Hey .
What &apos;s -- what &apos;s up ?
&lt; i &gt; So , listen , the heat &apos;s on , and there &apos;s nowhere left to turn , &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; so Morty and I are just gonna fly my spaceship into a black hole . &lt; / i &gt; - What ? !
&lt; i &gt; - Is that cool with you , dawg ? &lt; / i &gt; Rick , no !
- Morty ! !
- We got it .
The call &apos;s coming from ... ♪ inside the house ♪ Look at his face !
You dummy !
Can &apos;t believe our daughter married you .
Too easy !
The Ricks are probably gonna waste some time messing with Jerry .
They won &apos;t be able to help themselves .
But as soon as they get bored , they &apos;ll be onto us .
Phones à la clams and phonesghetti with phone balls .
- Anything else ?
- Yeah , more phone sticks , please .
Right away , sir .
You know , Rick , when I first saw all those Ricks and Mortys , I thought , &quot; Gee , that kind of devalues our bond &quot; .
But then I realized it just means that our relationship must be pretty special to span over all those different timelines .
Yeah , it &apos;s &lt; i &gt; got &lt; / i &gt; to be that way .
- You &apos;re a camouflage .
- Camouflage ?
What are you talking about , Rick ?
Ricks have a very distinctive and traceable brain wave due to our genius .
The best way to hide from an enemy &apos;s radar is to stand near someone with complementary brain waves that make ours invisible .
See , when a Rick is with a Morty , the genius waves get canceled out by the , uh ... ... Morty waves .
Um ... Because o-our personalities are so different ?
Oh , shit , dawg .
My portal gun was hacked remotely , Morty-- obviously by the real killer , to frame me .
But I was able to trace the signal .
Come on .
Let &apos;s go .
- Uh-oh .
- Excuse me .
We &apos;ve tracked a pair of dangerous criminals to this exact location .
They look exactly like us , so in order to avoid confusion , I &apos;m gonna mark us each with a red &quot; X &quot; right now .
That way , if someone has a gun and we both tell you to shoot the other one because &lt; i &gt; they &apos;re &lt; / i &gt; the evil one , you &apos;ll know who &apos;s lying .
Hey , check it out .
Damn it !
- Hey , you didn &apos;t pay your bill !
- The red &quot; X &quot; !
Red &quot; X &quot; !
Hey , it &apos;s a good thing that space outlet had lab coats and your favorite kind of shirt in stock , huh , Morty ?
Yeah , Rick , I-I heard you the first time .
You don &apos;t have to keep saying it over and over .
Man , this place is way off the grid .
This guy does not want to be found .
Well , if he &apos;s a Rick , doesn &apos;t he just have to stand by a Morty to hide ?
I mean , isn &apos;t that what Mortys are -- human cloaking devices ?
Morty , you &apos;re making a bigger deal out of this than it is .
Oh , my God , Rick , look !
There &apos;s a bunch of people strapped all over that building !
Not people , Morty -- Mortys .
Oh , God !
W-w-why would somebody do this ?
It &apos;s horrible !
Well , one Morty &apos;s enough to hide from the bureaucrats , but you get -- you get a whole matrix of Mortys and put them in agonizing pain , that creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks &#91; beep &#93; .
I fiddled with a concept like this once .
On paper , Morty .
On paper .
I wouldn &apos;t do this .
It &apos;s barbaric overkill .
I mean , you could accomplish the same result with , like , five Mortys and a jumper cable .
Which I also wouldn &apos;t do !
I &apos;m just saying , it &apos;s bad craftsmanship .
- Coffee time !
- Yeah !
Yo , yo , yo , yo !
That &apos;s what I like to hear !
- Hi , Jerry .
- Leave me alone .
I &apos;m working .
Oh , you are ?
W-w-w-what do you do ?
I-I &apos;m -- I &apos;m in between advertising jobs .
Advertising ?
Wow !
So , people need help figuring out what to buy , and then y-y-you help &apos; em ?
Well , it &apos;s a little more complicated than that .
Well , I mean , you do it , and you seem like a guy who really has it all together .
Dude , are you -- w-- you &apos;re being a dick , right ?
Oh , gosh , I-I hope not .
I wouldn &apos;t want to offend you in any way .
You &apos;re really a Rick ?
Y-- of course I am -- just as much as my Morty &apos;s a Morty .
Hey , he looks a lot like Eric Stoltz from the movie &quot; mask . &quot;
You know , the one with Cher in it ?
That &apos;s right , Jerry !
He -- he &apos;s from a reality where everyone is Eric Stoltz &quot; mask &quot; people .
He &apos;s Eric Stoltz mask Morty .
They assigned him to me because I never had any kids of my own .
But if I did , boy , I &apos;d love them if they were as smart and as successful as &lt; i &gt; you &lt; / i &gt; are , Jerry .
Hey , get a load of this .
Jerry &apos;s hanging out with doofus Rick .
This is perfect .
I &apos;m not doofus Rick !
I &apos;m Rick j19-zeta-7 !
Oh , is that the timeline where everybody eats poop ?
Jerry , you know this guy eats poop , right ?
Hey , I don &apos;t eat poop !
Y-you guys are always so mean to me .
I guess it &apos;s only fair to tell you now , Jerry .
I &apos;m the worst Rick of them all .
According to who -- other versions of you ?
If I &apos;ve learned one thing , it &apos;s that before you get anywhere in life , you got to stop listening to yourself .
Wow .
You really are wise , Jerry .
I-I-I guess that &apos;s why you work in advertising .
The fact that you feel that way makes you the &lt; i &gt; best &lt; / i &gt; Rick of them all .
You don &apos;t care about me at all !
I &apos;m no different than that jacket you &apos;ve got on !
Y-y-y-- o-or your stupid portal gun !
I &apos;m just a tool !
I-I-I &apos;m just an object !
Hey , it &apos;s your choice to take it personally , Morty .
Now , for the love of God , be quiet .
The point of this is to get the drop on the guy .
You know what , Rick ?
I &apos;ll tell you something !
I &apos;m more than a human shield !
Yeah , that &apos;s right .
You &lt; i &gt; are &lt; / i &gt; .
You &apos;re a perfect , impenetrable suit of human armor , Morty , because you &apos;re as dumb as I am smart , which is why when I say &quot; shut up , &quot; it &apos;s really good advice .
Great .
Nice work , Morty .
Ooh .
Look at you , C-137 .
You -- aren &apos;t you a tough customer .
The slow clap ?
Really ?
Kind of played out , dude .
Not in this dimension , it isn &apos;t .
In fact I invented it .
Nobody else has ever even done it here before .
Well , la-di-da .
Hey , that &apos;s mine !
I don &apos;t like the look of that Rick , Morty .
- We got to escape .
- I &apos;m not gonna help you , Rick .
- Y-you &apos;re a monster .
- Don &apos;t be Rick-diculous , Morty .
Will you -- will you stop saying that ?
It &apos;s stupid .
Take his Morty away .
Come with me .
Yeah , gladly .
Geez , man .
Ricks , huh ?
Hey , man , you seem to know how this place works .
Is there any way we could shut down that grid and rescue all those Mortys outside ?
It would be pointless .
Mortys have no chance of defeating a Rick .
In here .
- Ah .
Isn &apos;t it beautiful ?
- Yeah , yeah .
Looks like payday at Neverland ranch in here .
Zing !
&lt; i &gt; - That &lt; / i &gt; guy got it .
- Unh-unh-unh , Rick .
Quiet .
You &apos;re missing my symphony .
Hey , I &apos;ll take it over Mumford &amp; Sons .
Zip !
This guy is on it !
He &apos;s not laughing at your dumb jokes , Rick .
That &apos;s just a random noise it makes every 10 seconds .
You see , Rick , you &apos;re not as clever as you think you are .
I &lt; i &gt; wanted &lt; / i &gt; you to find me .
We &apos;re not so different , you and I. Yeah , duh !
See this right here , Rick ?
I crunched the numbers .
I created a spectrum of all the Ricks .
I listed them out from most evil to least evil .
Here &apos;s where I am .
And look it -- right here &apos;s where you are , Rick .
This guy right here -- super-weird .
I get it .
So you want me to team up with you to take down the council of Ricks , right ?
Is that where you &apos;re going with this ?
&apos;Cause that &apos;s where &lt; i &gt; I &apos;d &lt; / i &gt; be going .
Please .
I think I &apos;m doing pretty good on my own .
I &apos;m simply gonna download the contents of your brain and then kill you .
Okay , if we add a little more titanium nitrate and just a tad of chlorified tartrate ... ... Ovenless brownies !
Mmm .
Mmm !
It &apos;s incredible what a gifted mind can accomplish when priorities are in order .
Well , come on .
I can &apos;t take &lt; i &gt; all &lt; / i &gt; the credit , Jerry .
- It was &lt; i &gt; your &lt; / i &gt; idea .
- Come here , Jerry !
Hey , uh , come here .
I-I want to show you something .
Okay , look , everybody makes fun of me for getting these , but you &apos;re a genius scientist .
What do &lt; i &gt; you &lt; / i &gt; think ?
See ?
There &apos;s little R2-D2s where the George Washingtons should be .
You know , Jerry , I &apos;m not gonna tell you that these will increase in value or even hold their &lt; i &gt; current &lt; / i &gt; value .
The truth is , you bought them because you like them .
They have value to &lt; i &gt; you &lt; / i &gt; .
That &apos;s what matters .
- How long are you staying ?
- Until we find your Rick .
I found mine .
- Help !
- There is no escape , my son .
We will find our peace in the next world .
So , what -- you &apos;re just gonna give up ?
We &apos;re giving in -- to the power of the one true Morty .
One day , he will return .
Praise the one true Morty .
Ugh .
All right , Mortys , listen up .
My name is Morty Smith , from earth dimension C-137 .
I know you &apos;re scared , because &lt; i &gt; I &apos;m &lt; / i &gt; scared .
But that &apos;s no reason to accept our fate !
We &apos;re Mortys !
We &apos;re not defined by our relationships to Rick !
Our destiny is our own !
This sounds like something the one true Morty might say .
I &apos;m sick of being a human shield .
I want to be a gardener !
I want to write really crazy , intense action novels !
I &apos;m more than just a hammer !
He is the one true Morty !
Hooray !
The one true Morty !
Hey , keep it down !
You &apos;ve lived quite a life , Rick .
It &apos;s a real shame you &apos;re not gonna be around to see it through .
- You &apos;re crying ?
Over a Morty ?
- No , I &apos;m just allergic to dipshits .
Ugh .
Pathetic .
We both know that if there &apos;s any truth in the universe , it &apos;s that Ricks don &apos;t care about Mortys .
Do your worst , you little bastards !
Kill me !
Do it !
Do I-I-I-I-it !
Morty !
Thank God !
Get me out of this .
Come on !
You &apos;re lucky I &apos;m not a Rick .
Point taken , but this is no time for arcs .
Oh !
Yeah , hello .
Hey , what do me and O.J.
not have in common ?
Huh ?
W-who is this ?
I found the real killer , bitch !
Get over here !
Yo , ding-dong , we &apos;re done here .
Time to go .
Well , Jerry , I guess this means goodbye .
W-w-well , does it have to ?
I mean , you -- you look just like Rick .
We could maybe , you know , get rid of him .
I &apos;m not saying kill him , necessarily .
I -- I &apos;m also not saying necessarily &lt; i &gt; not &lt; / i &gt; kill him , but -- Jerry , w-we both know it wouldn &apos;t work .
It &apos;s time to go back to our lives .
I love you , Jerry .
I love you .
Hut !
Hut !
Hut !
Hut !
Hut !
Hut !
Hut !
Hut !
Hut !
Hut !
W-what -- w-what &apos;s gonna happen to all these Mortys ?
They &apos;ll go back to their families , attend school regularly , play video games , date girls .
Poor little rickless bastards .
Earth Rick C-137 , the council apologizes for its false accusation , and in the way of reparations for our terrible mistake , we would like to compensate you with this voucher for a free replacement Morty in the event that your current Morty should -- Uh , guys , not a good time .
Come on , Morty .
Let &apos;s hit it .
Is it time for arcs yet , Rick ?
I did a pretty good job back there for a human cloaking device .
Saved your ass .
All right , Morty .
Don &apos;t break an arm jerking yourself off .
Man , I can &apos;t believe you , Rick .
That right there , that w-- that was a great opportunity to show a little humanity , you know ?
- To connect with me a little .
- Hey , Morty , you want connection , go be part of some stupid club , like all those dumb Ricks .
You know , maybe I don &apos;t connect because I &apos;m the rickest Rick there is .
And , you know , it would g-- Go without saying that the rickest Rick would have the Mortyest Morty .
- It would go without saying , huh ?
- Yeah , it would .
- Did you hear me say it ?
- Nah .
The Mortyest Morty .
Just don &apos;t get too big for your loafers , Buster brown .
A cocky Morty can lead to some big problems .
It can be a real bad thing for everybody .
Oh , yeah ?
How &apos;s that ?
U-uh , I &apos;ll explain when you &apos;re older .
- What a mess .
- Pride cometh before the fall .
I guess he got what he deserved .
What is &lt; i &gt; that &lt; / i &gt; ?
Hand me the laser difibulator .
Hey , guys , uh , c-can I help ?
No !
Go clean the toilets .
Maybe you &apos;ll make friends with some turds .
You make us ashamed to be ourselves !
My God .
I &apos;ve seen this technology before .
This Rick was being controlled remotely -- puppeteered by somebody else .
This is the receiver .
Yeah , but where &apos;s the transmitter ?
- Wubba dubba dub dub !
- Oh .
Hey , Jerry .
What are you doing in my room , buddy ?
Nothing .
I was just , um , checking the smoke detectors .
All right .
Okay , get out .
What &apos;s that dipshit doing out there ?
Are you friends with him ?
You know he eats his own shit , right ?
Oh , my God , this is rich !
I &apos;ve got like 10 Ricks to call right now .
- Bye , mom !
Bye , dad !
- Drive carefully !
Have fun , you two .
Yes , we will have as much fun as possible on our ... &lt; i &gt; Titanic &lt; / i &gt; -themed getaway .
Let &apos;s lose the &apos; tude , please .
It &apos;s supposed to be romantic .
Speaking of disasters , dad , we are leaving you in charge , here .
I know , c-can we wrap this up ?
Morty and I have some synthetic laser eels oxidizing in the garage .
Hey , don &apos;t blow me off .
I am drawing a line , okay ?
Any damage to this house or these children when we get back , and ... no more adventures with Morty .
Aw , geez , Rick .
If my mom &apos;s the one who &apos;s saying it , then you know it &apos;s pretty serious this time .
That &apos;s right .
Wait .
What ?
Listen , you have my word as a caregiver , everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
And if not , like you say , no more adventures or whatever .
It &apos;s like that old song &quot; blomp blomp-a noop noop a-noop noop noop &quot; .
You guys know that song ?
From tiny rogerts ?
You never heard of it ?
You know , the black effeminate guy from the &apos; 50s ?
No-nobody ?
A-all right , whatever .
Look , who cares ?
Just go on your stupid trip .
Not one thing out of place .
Not a single thing .
Well , we &apos;re past the point of no return .
I &apos;m going to have a party .
Corrections by XhmikosR www.MY-SUBS.com I found jello .
Can you sneak your mom &apos;s vodka ?
Yes , she does .
I saw it in your laundry room .
Listen , you can &apos;t both be in denial about it .
Okay , bye .
Summer , you can &apos;t throw a party !
Remember what mom said ?
Yeah , if anything gets messed up , you and grandpa Rick get punished .
I &apos;m only a human being , Morty .
Rick , tell summer she can &apos;t have a party !
Uh , summer , you can &apos;t have a party .
Because I &apos;m having a party , b-I-I-I-itch !
Oh , what ? !
Rick , you can &apos;t !
What do you mean you &apos;re having a party ?
Are some glip glops from the third dimension going to come over and play cards or something ?
&quot; Glip glop ? &quot;
You &apos;re lucky a traflorkian doesn &apos;t hear you say that .
Is that like their n-word ?
It &apos;s like the n-word and the c-word had a baby and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews .
Listen , I think the three of us could just , you know , have a nice time , like just hanging out , and , you know , doing a little bonding and -- screw that .
This is my chance to gain some footing with the cool kids .
That &apos;s why you party ?
Boy , you really are 17 .
Why do you party ?
To get wr-wriggedy wriggedy wrecked , son !
Just keep your Sci-Fi friends away from my awesome ones .
Yeah , and you keep your awesome friends away from my canapes .
After dinner , &lt; i &gt; Titanic 2 &lt; / i &gt; will attach to the rail system near our replica iceberg , and the hydraulics encased in these tubes will execute a controlled sink into the icy depths .
A rail system seems archaic for an attraction this impressive .
Are you sure the ship will sink ?
I can assure you the ship will sink , as it has a thousand times before .
It is un-unsinkable .
Ooh !
Look , it &apos;s the line for the bow !
Jerry , I &apos;d love to just kick back with a Margarita and read .
Do you mind if I skip the whole &quot; king of the world &quot; bit ?
Well , it &apos;s not the &quot; king of the world &quot; bit .
That &apos;s Jack and fabrizio .
This is where rose says , &quot; I &apos;m flying , Jack ! &quot;
But whatever .
I can be the only one to do it alone .
Well , what about her ?
Excuse me , ma &apos;am .
Would you like to take my place in line ?
I , uh -- I could get into trouble .
We won &apos;t tell .
So ... - You &apos;re a &lt; i &gt; Titanic &lt; / i &gt; fanatic ?
- Oh , yes .
I &apos;ve worked here since it opened , but I &apos;ve never been able to participate .
Happy to help ... rose .
I love watching bukkake .
I mean , like , I don &apos;t know if I personally would ever do it ... Brad !
Hey !
Yo .
Brad is here !
Quick , make my hair look drunk .
Check it out .
Tammy &apos;s already drunk .
Cool .
The beacon was activated .
Who is in danger ?
Ugh !
Grandpa !
Birdperson !
I am pleased there is no emergency .
Oh , there &apos;s an emergency , all right .
A emergency !
When &apos;s the last time you got laid , &apos; pers ?
It has been a ... challenging mating season for birdperson .
Then it &apos;s time to get your beak wet tonight , playah .
Go have some fun out there birdp-- bird-- birdperson .
Oh , man , how many people did you invite , Rick ?
Uh ... people ?
Mm , six .
Yo !
What up , my glip glops ? !
Oh , man !
Oh !
Y-y-you know there &apos;s a garbage , right ?
Hey , uh , what the hell ? !
Ooh .
That &apos;s why you never invite a floopy doop and a shmoopy doop to the same party .
Oh , oh , g-- oh , that &apos;s disgusting !
You guys are in my parents &apos; bed !
Oh .
Sorry .
I &apos;m not feeling too well .
I just needed to lie down for a bit .
Oh .
Okay .
S-s-sorry .
Oh , my God !
Are you kidding me ? !
The thing people don &apos;t realize about the Gear Wars is that it was never really about the gears at all .
Uh-huh .
Yeah .
No , no , to-totally .
- Rick , you got to stop -- - Morty !
- Have you met gearhead ?
- Hey , how &apos;s -- Morty here , he -- he would love to hear all about the Gear Wars .
How familiar are you with the Gear Wars , exactly ?
Uh ... Not at all .
Oh , boy .
I envy you .
Okay , it was about 754 years ago ... Oh , hey , Morty !
H-have you -- have you met my buddy scropon ?
Not again , Rick .
That last guy droned on for 20 minutes , you know ?
And meanwhile , the whole house is being destroyed !
Whoa , Morty , this guy &apos;s entire planet was destroyed .
Have a little perspective .
Hey , Rick , squanchy party , bro !
Aw !
Squanchy !
Is there a good place for me to &lt; i &gt; squanch &lt; / i &gt; around here ?
Squanchy , you can squanch wherever you want , man .
- Mi casa es su casa , dawg !
- All right !
I like your squanch !
Uh , Rick , what exactly is &quot; squanching &quot; ?
Morty , listen -- we &apos;ve had a lot of really cool adventures over the last year , but it &apos;s time to relax .
Yeah , if I relax now , there might not even be any more adventures !
Jesus , Morty , you &apos;re bumming me out .
Can &apos;t we just pretend like everything &apos;s fine for a few hours , enjoy ourselves , and then worry about all this later ?
Yeah , that &apos;s easy for you to say , Rick .
You know , you like not caring about stuff .
You know , wh-wh-what &apos;s in this for me ?
For me ?
Jessica .
Knock it off , slow mobius !
Ha ha !
Sorry , dude !
I &apos;m just trying to show off my powers , bro !
I can &apos;t believe she &apos;s here .
Well , what are you doing standing here , Morty ?
Go .
Talk to her .
Tonight , the only adventure you &apos;re on is your cusping manhood .
Oh , Rose .
Whee !
Is that what I think it is ?
Yes , every couple gets to re-create Jack &apos;s drowning at the end of the movie .
It &apos;s so romantic .
I can &apos;t wait to do that with Beth .
I don &apos;t know , Jerry .
With all due respect , it seems like your wife may not be that interested .
Look !
&lt; i &gt; Iceberg , right ahead !
The buffet is now closed . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Iceberg , right ahead !
The buffet is now closed . &lt; / i &gt; Uh , sir ?
There &apos;s not a problem .
What do you mean there &apos;s &lt; i &gt; not &lt; / i &gt; a problem ?
The guidance system isn &apos;t putting us on a direct collision course .
This ship is about to completely miss the giant iceberg !
Well , do something !
Steer into it !
I &apos;m trying !
It &apos;s too late .
Ladies and gentlemen ... Don &apos;t brace yourselves .
No !
No !
What happened ? !
Their rail system must have failed .
Oh , my God !
We &apos;re not gonna sink !
Totally gonna get laid tonight .
I like your feathers .
They are designed to attract the attention of the female .
It &apos;s working .
Tammy , I should let you know I just got out of a highly intense soul bond with my previous spirit mate .
I &apos;m not looking to get into a soul bond .
I &apos;m just looking for ...
I believe birdperson can arrange that .
Hey , Summer , haven &apos;t seen you at flute practice in a while .
Summer , don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re friends with her .
Are you kidding me ?
I don &apos;t even know what she &apos;s doing here .
Whoa .
Not cool , summer .
This is a party .
Everybody should be welcome .
Oh , great .
Who invited Abradolph Lincoler ?
I thought everyone was welcome .
It &apos;s not the same , Summer .
Lincoler is a crazed maniac -- just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral superleader by combining the DNA of Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln .
Turns out it just adds up to a lame , weird loser .
Rick , you brought me into this world , a suffering abomination tortured by the duality of its being .
But I shall finally know peace when I watch the life drain from your wretched body !
Whoa .
What &apos;s up , man ?
I have no quarrel with you , boy .
&quot; Boy &quot; ?
What &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
It &apos;s just -- l-look , I-I don &apos;t know how you thought I meant it , but ... Don &apos;t look at me , dude .
Look , I &apos;m half-Abraham Lincoln , so -- So I should get on my knees and kiss your ass ? !
Well , no , but ... - You know ?
- What do I know ?
That the third reich will reign for a thousand years ?
Leave him alone , Brad .
Stay out of this , Jessica !
Kick his ass , Brad !
Kick his ass !
Kick his ass !
Kick his ass !
Brad !
Rick !
I just did you a favor , Morty .
Sorry about all that .
Rick has some really strange friends .
Ugh !
Brad is such a jerk .
He &apos;s always trying to prove what a man he is .
I just want to find somebody nice and sweet .
Jessica , can I show you something ?
Wow !
Look at all this stuff .
Yeah .
This is me and my grandpa Rick &apos;s Sci-Fi workshop .
Check this out .
It &apos;s beautiful .
You know , Jessica , there &apos;s something I &apos;ve always wanted to tell you .
What &apos;s that , Morty ?
I think that you &apos;re the most -- No , that -- those weird sounds coming from the closet over there .
- Oh , my God !
- Aah !
Hey , I &apos;m squanching in here !
Oh , my God !
Oh , that is so disgusting !
Ow !
Oh !
Oh , crap !
Huh .
Big star in the sky .
Oxygen-rich atmosphere .
Giant testicle monsters .
We &apos;ll be fine !
Let &apos;s party !
♪ Just shake that ass , bitch , and let me see whatcha got ♪ I swear to God , Morty , if it weren &apos;t for the fact that everyone &apos;s still having a blast in there , I would be so furious with you right now .
Oh , man .
Y-you hear that , Morty ?
You really lucked out with Summer o-on that one .
How are you guys not freaking out right now ? !
T-the whole house is sitting in another dimension !
I-I mean , w-what the hell are we supposed to do ? !
M-m-mom and dad are gonna kill us !
- I &apos;m losing it here , Rick !
- Relax , Morty , relax !
It &apos;s gonna be fine .
All we have to do is go out and find us some kalaxian crystals .
Oh , shit , mother &#91; beep &#93; !
Kalaxian crystals , Morty , just a few miles South of here .
Okay .
Let &apos;s go , then .
W-w-we got to go get those crystals right now , Rick .
Whoa , whoa , whoa .
Morty , Morty , I-I can &apos;t go with you .
I got to hang back and make sure everything stays cool here , you know ?
I mean , who knows what -- what if somebody breaks something ?
Yeah .
Me too .
I should stay .
You guys have any aspirin ?
Oh , hey , Morty , this is perfect !
You can take Lincoler with you .
Hey , man , I &apos;m not going anywhere .
- I &apos;m injured .
- Shut up , Lincoler .
It &apos;s the least you can do for wrecking the living room .
Yeah !
And , Nancy , you should go , too .
What ?
Why -- why me ?
Because , uh , you &apos;re -- you &apos;re so good at playing the flute .
Sorry for the inconvenience , folks .
We should resume sinking shortly .
In the meantime , please , stay on the ship and enjoy a complimentary plate of James Cameronion rings .
Great .
Not only is the ship not sinking , but now the fourth wall has been broken .
I am gonna go back to the room to finish my book .
You should find that Lucy woman .
But -- but -- You see , Jerry ?
May I show you something ?
Had everything gone as planned , this entire area would be underwater .
I would have liked to see it .
This trip has been a &quot; Titanic &quot; failure .
Get it ?
Ooh !
- Draw me , Jerry .
- Oh , boy .
Lucy , wow .
Uh , this isn &apos;t what I had in mind .
But it &apos;s the perfect moment .
We &apos;ve been dreaming about this for 16 years .
Um , not like this .
Not -- not with you .
- You are gonna draw me .
- Aah !
Then you &apos;re going to &#91; beep &#93; me in that car over there .
It &apos;s weird , &apos; cause I definitely think that all men are created equal .
But , at the same time -- Okay !
Um , the crystals should be really close .
There they are !
Wait .
Something &apos;s not right .
Get the crystals !
I &apos;ll handle the beast !
Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes !
Summer &apos;s gonna like me again .
Lincoler , come on !
Let &apos;s get out of here !
Mein journey is over , Morty .
I have something important to tell you .
♪ And the gears , they turned for a thousand years ♪ ♪ until the dark day that they stopped ♪ Rick , I got them !
- I got the crystals !
- All right !
- You did it , Morty .
- Rick , wait !
There &apos;s something you need to know .
I couldn &apos;t have done it without Lincoler .
He said that he was really sorry and that he loves you like a father .
He only wanted you to accept him , and he hopes that his final act would redeem him in your eyes .
He sacrificed himself to save all of us , Rick .
He died .
Well , at least he didn &apos;t die in vain .
He got these crystals .
And these babies just saved this lame-ass party !
Wubba , lubba , dub , dub !

What the hell was that ? !
I thought those crystals were supposed to help us get home or something !
What ?
No , no , no .
I can get us home whenever I want to .
But , listen , speaking of those crystals , can I get the rest of them ?
I &apos;m starting to come down , Morty .
Crystal kalaxian is a really strong , but fleeting high .
That &apos;s what I think of your crystals , Rick !
Oh , Morty , you idiot !
Does anybody else have any more k-lax ?
B-birdperson ?
Uh , squanchy ?
Don &apos;t squaunch at me .
All right , everybody , party is officially over !
Rick , take us home now .
All right , all right , fine , Morty , you party pooper buzzkill !
Boo , boo !
Morty sucks !
Boo !
You suck , whatever your name is .
Boo !
Morty , you &apos;re the worst , Morty .
But these gears just started turnin &apos; .
Almost finished , Jerry ?
Uh , almost .
I haven &apos;t quite captured your beautiful eyes .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s good enough .
Move !
Every weekend , Jacks and Roses have their Titanic experience in this car , and I have to mop it up .
The floor drops out to make it easier .
But now it &apos;s my turn .
We &apos;re going to get it nice and steamy in there , and I &apos;m going to slam my hand on the steam and leave a nice handprint , and then you &apos;re going to love inside of me .
No mess .
No clean .
Beth !
Bet you &apos;re glad I think kindles are dumb now .
I can &apos;t help but feel a little guilty .
I didn &apos;t peg Lucy for a rapist .
What does a rapist look like exactly , Beth ?
Is it a slavic man wearing a denim jacket with a patchy beard and the scent of cheap champagne wafting over his blister-pocked lips ?
What ?
Well , at least you got all this free stuff .
Should be enough to satisfy your &lt; i &gt; Titanic &lt; / i &gt; Jones for a while .
I &apos;m not going to fit .
Beth , listen to me .
You &apos;re going to get out of here .
You &apos;re gonna go on , and -- Jerry , just leave the door .
It &apos;s not a door , Beth .
- It &apos;s debris .
- I don &apos;t care .
Just leave it .
Yeah .
Okay .
&quot; Cape fear &quot; !
&quot; Cape fear &quot; !
I &apos;m -- I &apos;m doing -- I &apos;m -- I &apos;m going to do like from &quot; cape fear &quot; .
Hey , squanchers !
The party &apos;s squanching on at my place !
Cool .
I &apos;m coming , too .
Uh , no .
You &apos;re not squanchy enough for a squanchy party .
What ?
Nancy told us what a bitch you are .
Guys , seriously .
Nancy ?
Summer , you &apos;re a bad person .
All you care about is having popular people like you .
That &apos;s not what Abradolph Lincoler stood for .
Well , I-it was hard to pin down &lt; i &gt; what &lt; / i &gt; he stood for , but it &apos;s certainly not what he died for .
Next time I party , I &apos;m just gonna focus on getting totally wrecked .
You &apos;re so wise .
May I assist you with that ?
Uh , sure , yeah .
Thanks .
Morty , do you know what &quot; wubba lubba dub dub &quot; means ?
Uh , that &apos;s just Rick &apos;s stupid nonsense catchphrase .
It &apos;s not nonsense at all .
In my people &apos;s tongue , it means , &quot; I am in great pain .
Please help me . &quot;
Well , I got news for you .
He &apos;s saying it ironically .
No , Morty .
Your grandfather is , indeed , in very deep pain .
That is why he must numb himself .
Come on , um ... Birdperson .
Come on , birdperson .
Rick &apos;s not that complicated .
He &apos;s just a huge asshole .
Then why do you care so much if you are no longer allowed to continue on your adventures together ?
It appears fate has presented you with an opportunity to free yourself of Rick forever .
You know what ?
You &apos;re right .
I shouldn &apos;t even care .
This is probably the best thing that could have happened to me .
I &apos;m sick of having adventures with Rick .
My people have another saying-- &quot; gubba nub nub doo rah kah &quot; .
It means , &quot; whatever lets you sleep at night &quot; .
Guys , mom and dad are , like , right around the corner .
This is your moment , Morty .
Choose wisely .
Tammy !
Caw !
Wow .
We are so screwed .
- Rick , wake up .
- Huh ?
What ?
Wait ?
What ?
What ?
Stop .
Rick , you got to do something quick .
My parents are home .
Uh , all -- all right .
All right .
Hold -- hold on .
Ahh !
So good .
Oh , my God .
They &apos;re walking up the driveway .
- Bring me the thing .
- What -- what thing ?
The thing .
The thing .
The -- the -- it &apos;s got , like , buttons on it and lights on it .
It -- it -- it beeps .
Rick !
That describes everything in your garage !
Do you mean this ?
Summer for for the win .
All right , that should do it .
Whoa !
What did you do ?
Uh , s-see for yourself .
Whoa !
Yeah , e-everything &apos;s frozen in time .
Yeah , and slow mobius thinks he &apos;s all that .
- For how long ?
- I don &apos;t know .
How long do you guys want ?
A week ?
A month ?
Can we start cleaning the house and see how we feel ?
- Worst movie ever .
- Dumb .
Ooh , boy , what a waste of time .
Get it ?
You know , &apos; cause it &apos;s frozen .
This has been so much fun .
Hey , Rick .
You know , this whole time , I haven &apos;t once heard you say that &quot; wubba lubba dub dub &quot; thing that you usually say .
Don &apos;t need to .
I have a new catchphrase .
Oh , yeah ?
What -- what &apos;s that , Rick ?
I love my grandkids .
- Aww .
- Psych !
Just kidding -- my new catchphrase is , &quot; I don &apos;t give a &#91; beep &#93; &quot; .

Grandpa &apos;s about to un-freeze time .
You really should be cleaning from top to bottom .
I know how to vacuum mom and dad , summer .
I &apos;ve been doing it for six months .
Then you &apos;ve been doing it wrong for six months .
Oh , my God , is that mildew ?
It &apos;s not my fault we froze time on a humid day .
You have dropped so many balls , man .
Do you ever get scared grandpa Rick might make me his new sidekick ?
What ? !
What kind of monster are you ?
A competent one .
Who cares about the &#91; Burps &#93; things you guys are talking about ?
&#91; Burps &#93; The whole point of freezing time was to stop gmng a &#91; Bleep &#93; Put a shirt on your dumb dad , and let &apos;s get this dumb universe rolling .
Let &apos;s do this thing .
All right , listen , you two .
We froze time for a pretty long time , so when I un-freeze it , the world &apos;s time is gonna be fine , but our time &apos;s gonna need a little time to , you know , stabilize .
Our time is gonna be unstable ?
What does that even mean ?
It means relax and stop being a pussy , morty .
Uh , I thought you learned that by now .
It also means don &apos;t touch your parents , or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards .

Our time is fractured ... You two somehow created a feedback look of uncertainty that split our reality into two equally possible impossibilities .
W-we &apos;re exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker .
We &apos;re entirely hypothetical .
But I thought there were infinite time lines ?
We &apos;re not on any time line , dummy .

Well , do we ... do I , uh , get , uh , a big rock , or ... ?
It &apos;s not an armadillo , asshole .

It &apos;s not like I could &apos;ve actually done it .
If we were near a hospital , I could treat it , but I ...
I think we have to just ...
It &apos;s okay .

And even if we were in a hospital , what could we do ?
You &apos;re a horse surgeon , not a deer surgeon .

Yes , Beth .

Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable .
Eventually , everything either is or isn &apos;t .

- Oh &#91; Bleep &#93; What the hell is wrong with you two ?
I-I-I-I mean you four !
Both : That hurt !
That was painful .
Good , I &apos;m glad it was painful .
You deserve it .
I saw you .
Y-you &apos;re both &#91; Burps &#93; all over the damn place .
We &apos;ve been split for 20 minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum &#91; Bleep &#93; wind ?
What the hell do either of you two have to be so uncertain about ?
Your brand of zit cream ?
Which chair to sit in while I do everything ?
Come on , spit it out !
Well , you don &apos;t exactly make it easy , Rick .
You make fun of me all the time ... You &apos;re always picking on me ... And now summer &apos;s doing it ... and now you got summer to kiss your ass .
Me ? !
What about you ?
You &apos;re just as mean to me because you &apos;re jealous ... Could you get more excited to see me fail ?
Because you want grandpa all to yourself !
All right , all right , cool it .
I see what &apos;s happening here .
You &apos;re both young , you &apos;re both unsure about your place in the universe , and you both want to be grandpa &apos;s favorite .
I can fix this .
Morty , sit here .
Summer , you sit here .
Now , listen .
I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways , but you have to understand that as far as grandpa &apos;s concerned , you &apos;re both pieces of shit .
Yeah .
I can prove it mathematically .
Actually , l-l-let me grab my white board .
This has been a long time coming , anyway .
&#91; Tires screech &#93; Emergency !
Wounded deer coming in .
&#91; Air hissing &#93; - Three .
Excuse me , you can &apos;t be back here .
I &apos;m a certified horse surgeon , and this deer needs medical attention .
- Nurse , please move that snake .
- That &apos;s &lt; i &gt; my &lt; / i &gt; nurse .
And as a horse surgeon , I &apos;m sure that you know that deer have much smaller , much more intricate organs .
As a vet , I &apos;m sure you know that a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor .
So let &apos;s save the measuring for when our dicks are out .
- It &apos;s time to save a life !
- Geez .
&#91; Grunts , sighs &#93; That &apos;s odd .
This deer &apos;s wounded .
Uh , yeah , I was there .
You don &apos;t have to rub it in .
I mean it &apos;s been shot with a gun .
Man : My gun .
May I help &lt; i &gt; you , &lt; / i &gt; sir ?
No , but you can stop helping this deer .
I shot it before these two hit it with their car , and I followed them when they hauled it off .
This deer belongs to me .
&#91; Sighs &#93; We don &apos;t have time for this , okay ?
I need anaesthetic and deer saline .
Look , I don &apos;t know what the law says about this , but I took an oath that I would let no animal come to harm .
Except when sterilizing , aborting , or euthanizing them , or also when eating them at also any meal .
I &apos;m calling my lawyer .
I hope for all our sakes you &apos;re as bad a surgeon as I am a hunter .
In your dreams , bitch .
Scalpel .
So , in conclusion , you &apos;re both equally mercurial , overly sensitive , clingy , hysterical , bird-brained homunculi .
And I honestly can &apos;t even tell the two of you apart half the time because I don &apos;t Go by height or age , I Go by amount of pain in my ass , which makes you both identical .
All right , everything resolved ?
Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world .
Yes .
Yes .
Yes .
Yes .
All right , perfect .
Sit still .
&#91; Burps &#93; Arms down .
I &apos;m gonna do this again .
This time be like grandpa .
You mean drunk ?
What &apos;s that ?
You got something to say ?
- No .
- And away we Go !
And away we Go !
- Huh , that &apos;s weird .
- Huh , that &apos;s weird .
&#91; Button clicking &#93; - Oh , my God .
- What ?
- Oh , my God .
- What ?
The son of a bitch is gonna kill me !
What ? !
The son of a bitch is gonna kill me !
What ? !
Diabolical , unfeeling sociopath .
- Don &apos;t you get it ? !
- Don &apos;t you get it ? !
The other Rick isn &apos;t trying to merge us anymore .
He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me .
He probably figures it &apos;s &#91; Belches &#93; easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them .
&#91; Laughs &#93; I have to admit , it was always in the back of my mind , too .
The difference is I would never do it , until now .
Rick , what the hell are you doing ?
Saving our lives !
After he takes me out , he &apos;s ...
He &apos;s gonna be coming for you .
- Who ?
- Me !
&#91; Gunshot &#93; - Aah !
- Whoa !
- You see that ?
Get down !
I told you , he &apos;s a psycho .
He &apos;s lost it !
Th-th-th-the time fracture must have made him crazy !
- I don &apos;t know what to do !
- Oh , crap !
I don &apos;t know what to do !
&#91; Rumbling &#93; &#91; Device beeps &#93; Oh , God , now there &apos;s three of them .
We &apos;re outnumbered .
Get in the cupboards .
Wait , don &apos;t ... don &apos;t do that .
They &apos;ll know .
Wait , wait .
Think about getting in the cupboards , but don &apos;t really .
&#91; Gunshots &#93; &#91; Screams &#93; Is this what you want , you sick &#91; Bleep &#93; ? !
You want to see children die ? !
You son of a bitch .
You don &apos;t stop lmng until I say so !
Michael .
- Who &apos;s this now ?
- My lawyer .
I &apos;m here to notify you , ma &apos;am , that in this county , any deer shot by a hunter is that hunter &apos;s property regardless of how far it runs or who intercepts it before it dies .
It &apos;s called Brad &apos;s law .
We can &apos;t make you stop the surgery , but at this point , you &apos;re performing it on venison .
Actually , I &apos;ve decided not to eat it .
All this fear and conflict ...
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s ruined the meat .
I &apos;m just gonna use the head for my rec-room wall .
She normally works on horses .
Jerry , if you &apos;re not gonna help , get the &#91; Bleep &#93; out of here .
I will reach into heaven and yank your screaming deer soul back !
Jesus .
Shh , shh !
I know where you are , you creepy old monster .
I know how you think .
Oh , is there where you think I &apos;m going ?
You think I &apos;m standing here ?
Well , maybe you &apos;re right .
&#91; Morty grunts &#93; &#91; Rick groans &#93; Summer : Holy &#91; Bleep &#93; now what ?
Well , if all of me knocked out all the ricks , and you peed in all of your pants , doesn &apos;t that mean that we &apos;re all synchronized ?
- Right .
- Okay .
So , from now on , whatever we do , we have to be certain .
Right .
I think I &apos;m certain we &apos;re effed in the &quot; a . &quot;
&#91; Cats meowing , purring &#93; Oh , God , my head .
&#91; Groans &#93; What did you guys do ?
We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy and you caused another time fracture .
You tried to kill yourself .
O-only in self-defense .
Myself tried to kill me first .
Guys , I don &apos;t expect you to understand this , but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we &apos;ve got half as much time to solve it .
Well , actually , I do expect you to understand that .
It &apos;s basic math .
C-can somebody just let me out of here ?
If I die in a cage , I lose a bet .
Well , is there some way you can prove you &apos;re not a threat to yourself and others anymore ?
Oh , for God &apos;s sake .
All right , here .
- Give me the time crystal .
- Wh-what are you doing ?
Calling myself .
Here , listen .
It &apos;ll &#91; Burps &#93; probably Go to voicemail since , you know , I &apos;m calling myself .
&lt; i &gt; Hello , Rick here . &lt; / i &gt; Don &apos;t fall for it .
It &apos;s a bit .
&lt; i &gt; Just kidding !
Ha , ha ! &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; You just got ricked . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; You &apos;ve reached &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Rick &apos;s voicemail . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; You know what to do . &lt; / i &gt; &#91; &lt; i &gt; Bee &lt; / i &gt; &#93; Hey , Rick .

No hard feelings .

Okay , well , we &apos;re still not gonna let you out of this crate .
Fine .
I &apos;ll just do it myself .
If you could get out that whole time , why didn &apos;t you ?
Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do , morty .
That &apos;s the difference between you and me .
I &apos;m certain , and you &apos;re a walking burlap sack filled with turds .
You know , geez , Rick !
Y-y-you &apos;re really tearing into me right now .
You know , words hurt .
- Holy !
- A monster !
Hey , you ... hey , quit yelling .
Quit yelling .
What the &#91; Bleep &#93; Your time is all ripped up to hell !
&#91; Warbles &#93; You broke your time twice .
- &#91; Sighs &#93; - How did this happen ?
&#91; All speaking indistinctly &#93; Nevermind .
Shut the &#91; Bleep &#93; up .
Oh , damn .
I &apos;m from the fourth dimension .
I can hear all of y &apos;all .
Now let &apos;s just see what we got here for a second .
- &#91; Groans &#93; - Hey , damn it .
Were you trying to use this to ... Oh , see , you broke time , and you thought you could just stick it back together with this ?
How you think you gonna move time while you &apos;re standing in it , you dumbass three-dimensional monkey-ass dummies ?
Oh , way to Go , Rick .
Yeah , grandpa , way to Go .
What , you &apos;re just gonna listen to this guy now ?
He &apos;s got a giant testicle for a head .
He came here in a bubble .
For all we know , he could be the David berkowitz of nutsackland .
Shut up .
Here , put these on .
They &apos;ll sync your possibilities up so I can bring you back to certain time .
Y &apos;all are just ... Just ... just negligent .
See , now ... Now look right here .
Hey , hey , hey , the three of you , put your collars on .
- We have them on .
- What are you talking about ?
- Uh , we did .
- We &apos;re not wearing collars .
Exactly .
&apos;Cause you &apos;re being obstinate .
&#91; Belches &#93; What ?
Put the damn collars on if you want to live .
- They &apos;re on right now .
- We did .
They &apos;re on .
All right , fine .
Summer , morty , put them on .
&#91; Device beeps &#93; &#91; Warbling &#93; - Yes , we &apos;re back !
- No more cats !
- We &apos;re back in certain time .
- Problem solved .
No more cats !
Oh , you did it !
- You fixed it .
- Yeah , I did .
Now keep those collars on so you don &apos;t break your weak-ass time again .
How long , exactly , do we have to wear these things ?
They &apos;re really embarrassing .
Well , since you &apos;re going to time prison , I &apos;d say you can keep them on forever .
- Time prison ?
- Yeah .
Well , I don &apos;t know where you expect me to think you got that crystal over there , but the only way your dumbass assin &apos; ass asses could ever have on is if it was stolen .
You stole a time-freezing crystal from testicle monsters ? !
I would &apos;ve been happy to pay for it , s ... &#91; burps &#93; Summer , but they don &apos;t exactly sell them at costco .
Besides , there &apos;s a larger lesson to be learned here .
Get him !
No , no , no , no !
You better keep back !
Man , this will turn your ass into a third-trimester fetus from 30 yards .
&#91; Monitor beeping &#93; Mm .
Isn &apos;t there a kitten somewhere that needs a manicure ?
That &apos;s right , Mrs. Smith .
Give in to your anger .
Neglect that deer .
Honey , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
These men are from the cervine institute of of elk , moose , deer , and stag .
They can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the country &apos;s top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border .
Where your jurisdiction ends .
I guess that &apos;s the end of that .
There is just one more thing .
According to this state &apos;s veterinarian statute , this animal can &apos;t be transferred until the current attending physician verbally confirms their inability to provide adequate care .
You heard the man , horse doctor .
You have to say you couldn &apos;t hack it .
We did it !
Uh-huh .
No , mother ... no .
Earth , dude .
No , I &apos;m talking about ... Yeah , with the dinosaurs .
No , if you get to the dolphin people , you gone too far .
All right , man , I &apos;ll talk to you later .
Okay .
You know what they do to third-dimensional life forms in time prison ?
Same thing they do in every other prison , only forever .
Why are you doing this ?
You think I want to be an omniscient immortal being transcending time and space my whole life ?
I got ambitions , man .
Bringing you guys in is my ticket up .
What if I told you there &apos;s a huge ticket up right behind you ?
You really think I &apos;m that stupid ?
All right , hear me out on this .
You &apos;re immortal , right , which means your life is infinite .
Okay , well , then that means there &apos;s a 100 % chance that you &apos;ll eventually do everything , including turning around to look behind you .
I cannot argue that .
&#91; Thud ! &#93;
- Aaah !

Chris !

I suppose the answer is I &apos;m not certain .
Oh , no , what are you doing ?
- I have no idea .
- I &apos;m not sure .

Oh , man .
Don &apos;t you have to fix , like , 30 of them ?
Morty , I have to fix three of them .
And then there &apos;s 31 other versions of me that have to also fix three , for a total of 96 .
I &apos;m not an idiot .
I know how to be decisive .
Now hand me that flat-head screwdriver .
Now hand me that Phillips screwdriver .
- Actually , make it a flat-head .
- Actually , make it a Phillips .
Oh , shit .
Look , I know I was kind of a nuisance today .
I know it &apos;s my fault we hit the deer .
And I know you wanted to be the one to save it .
Whatever .
How petty would I have to be to care less about an animal &apos;s life than my own ego ?
Well , you &apos;d have to be pretty petty .
But you &apos;d still be the woman I married .

The collar .
Oh , the latch is broken .
It won &apos;t latch closed around my neck .
- Oh , are you kidding me ?
- Geez , what &apos;s going on ?
How come our collars aren &apos;t green ?
Obviously because someone doesn &apos;t know how to put his collar on , and one of me is stuck trying to help him .
Don &apos;t blame this on me .
You &apos;re the one that couldn &apos;t fix a latch .
What are you talking about ?
It &apos;s not broken , morty .
I fixed it .
Just put it on .
It won &apos;t close .

Aah !
Roy , what &apos;s wrong ?
I had a nightmare .
I was with an old man .
He put a helmet on me .
It &apos;s just a fever .

Roy Parsons is at the 20 !
Now he &apos;s at the 10 !
Nothing can stop Roy &quot; the Rocket &quot; !
Touchdown !
I just think it &apos;s time to get realistic .
Have you talked to my father about the carpet store ?
Roy ?
Had we caught it sooner well , hindsight is 20 / 20 , Roy .
What &apos;s important is that we move quickly .
I &apos;m not ready to die .
You &apos;re not going to .
- Yeah !
Whoo !
- Yeah !
Hey , thanks for the carpet , Roy .
Hey , Roy , you pulled those persian off-white shags for the clearance sale ?
Whoa .
Sh shit !
Oh !
Whoa !
What the hell ? !
W-w-where am I ? !
- What in the hell ? !
- 55 years .
Not bad , Morty .
You kind of wasted your 30s , though , with that whole bird-watching phase .
- Where &apos;s my wife ? !
- Morty , you were just playing a game .
It &apos;s called &quot; Roy &quot; .
Snap out of it .
Come on .
I &apos;m Morty .
You &apos;re Rick .
Hey !
You sold a gun to a guy that kills people !
Look at this you beat cancer , and then you went back to work at the carpet store ?
Boo !
D-don &apos;t dodge the issue , Rick !
Selling a gun to a hit man is the same as pulling the trigger !
It &apos;s also the same as doing nothing .
If Krombopulos Michael wants someone dead , there &apos;s not a lot anyone can do to stop him .
That &apos;s why he does it for a living .
Now excuse me .
It &apos;s time to thrash your &quot; Roy &quot; score .
You know , you could stop this killing from happening , Rick !
You know , you did a bad thing selling that gun , but you could undo it if you wanted .
Uh-huh , yeah , that &apos;s the difference between you and me , Morty .
- I never go back to the carpet store .
- Holy shit !
This guy &apos;s taking Roy off the grid !
This guy doesn &apos;t have a social security number for Roy !

I didn &apos;t know freedom meant people doing stuff that sucks .
I was thinking more of a choose your own cellphone-carrier thing .
Oh , Summer , you did nothing wrong .
I &apos;m having fun with your grandpa .
Lost a little control .
Probably shouldn &apos;t be piloting a hovercopter , nor should I be running 200,000 pediatric hospitals and 12 million deep fryers , but hey , it &apos;s not like this planet can take its business elsewhere .
Um , should we maybe stop somewhere and get you a coffee ?
Maybe splash a little water on your face , or ... No , no , if I wanted to be sober , I wouldn &apos;t have gotten drunk .
Whoo-hoo-hoo !
Oh , man .
I cannot wait-- I cannot wait to hear Rick explain his way around this .
He is gone .
Jerry , stop , please , okay ?
We weren &apos;t even supposed to be down here .
If we confront him about this-- Oh , my god !
I love this .
I love that this is how far you will go for him .
You want to go upstairs and cut carrots and watch a Lifetime original above a &#91; bleep &#93; alien dungeon !

Oh , listen to you relish the idea that my genius father is a bad person .
Step out of your ego for a second and look at this thing ; it &apos;s a monster .
He might have it chained up so that it doesn &apos;t eat the planet !
Right , because your father &apos;s such an altruist ?
I once saw him briefly forget the word for &quot; humans &quot; .
He &apos;s probably harvesting this creature &apos;s organs .

Ah , I &apos;ll push it to next week .
Unity , could you get Rick out here , please ?
He &apos;s unavailable .
He &apos;s ... Having sex with you .
We get it .
Gross .
Get him out here now .
I don &apos;t think he wants to be-- - Grandpa Rick !
- Rick !
Rick !
I &apos;m gonna tell mom and dad about the gagoo you have locked up under the garage !
What the hell is your problem ?
Grandpa , we need to go home , now .
Fine .
Sheesh .
See you .
Uh , Rick , I think we should allgo .
Tend to your garden , kids .
I &apos;m kind of doing a thing here .
Whoo !
Grandpa Rick , we &apos;re not leaving without you .
Oh , my god , you guys .
I get it .
You &apos;re afraid the big , bad hive mind is gonna steal your grandpa away .
Actually , no .
I think Unity &apos;s great and you &apos;re a horrible influence on it .
- What ?
- This isn &apos;t healthy , Rick .
You know , you &apos;re really up to no good around here a-at this place , you know ?
You and Unity are like ... like leggings and mid-calf boots .
You think you &apos;re great together , but you &apos;re just bringing out the worst in each other .
Oh , gee .
Boy , Summer .
Well put .
Uh , why don &apos;t we see what Unity thinks ?
Unity ?
I &apos;m just taking a little break from stuff .
You know ?
I need to relax .
Oh , hey , w-what &apos;s this on the news , guys ?
Let me turn it up .
In the news today , this looks a lot worse than it is .
We &apos;re really just having a good time .
- Karen ?
- Thanks , Todd .
Up next , are you a concerned grandchild or just a buzzkill ?
We &apos;ll tell you how you can know for sure .
I think you two are a little outnumbered .
Okay , well , what if you did it for me ?
What if you came with us as a favor to us because you love us ?
What ?
Dumb .
Bye .
But Rick , Summer &apos;s just--- Summer &apos;s just a hyper-emotional , needy little-- What &apos;s the word I &apos;m looking for here ?
Uh ... Human .
It runs in the family .
I can tolerate it , but I can &apos;t give a crap about it .
Take a hike .
Take care of yourself , Unity .
I &apos;m not looking for judgment , just a yes or no ... can you assimilate a giraffe ?
- You &apos;re the worst !
- No , you &apos;re the worst !
You don &apos;t support this family !
All you care about is yourself !
- Is about supporting you emotionally ... - You &apos;ve got two children ... - ... but you &apos;re unsupportable .
- ... Being dragged across the cosmos ... - ... because it &apos;s never enough , Jerry !
- ... By your dangerously ill father !
And you force me to watch it happen because you &apos;d rather lose them and lose me ... And you don &apos;t even know what it &apos;s like to be afraid of losing anything ... Than lose him !
- Because you cling and you cling - Because you &apos;re the child , Beth !
You , not me !
You !
- Aah !
- Aah !
- Oh , my god .
- Aah !
Um , first of all , hello .
Uh , my name is Blim Blam the Korblok .
Second of all , cards on the table , I &apos;m a murderer that eats babies , and I came to this planet to eat babies .
However , I am also carrying a highly infectious disease that I suppose you could call &quot; space AIDS &quot; as you put it .
And Rick did chain me up so that he could attempt to cure it .
At the same time , Rick &apos;s motivation to cure my disease was not to save my life or anyone else &apos;s , but to patent and sell the cure for billions of blemflarcks .
But you know the reason why I ripped my chains out of the wall ?
And do you know why I &apos;m never coming back to this planet ?
Because the two of you are the &#91; bleep &#93; worst !
You both hate yourselves and each other .
And the idea that it has anything to do with Rick is laughable .
I &apos;d laugh , but I &apos;m biologically incapable .
That &apos;s how alien I am .
And even I &apos;m sitting here listening to the two of you and being like , &quot; What the &#91; beep &#93; &quot; ?
So good luck with your shitty marriage , and tell Rick I &apos;m sorry he has to deal with either of you .
Blim Blam out .
You know what ?
I &apos;m taking this .
How do you-- What is this ?
Uh , is there a slow setting ?
Best door ever .
Okay , okay .
Now make them cry , but happy crying .
Now make them all make fun of the blonde one .
Now make them all do it on the table .
I can &apos;t believe you created a whole show for me .
Now cancel it .
Okay , now put it back on .
All right , I &apos;m bored .
Rick , is there a way for you to call Summer and Morty ?
- I feel bad that they-- - Pbht .
Screw those guys .
Ugh .
I &apos;ll be right back .
Don &apos;t waste your brain on those weirdos , Unity .
They &apos;re no different from any of the aimless chumps that you occupy .
They just put you at the center of their lives because you &apos;re powerful .
And then because they put you there , they want you to be less powerful .
Never gonna happen though , right ?
Never .
Never .
Back in a flash .
Best weekend ever , Rick .
I agree , Rick .
Let &apos;s see how long we can go .
Hey , Une .
You got any more-- Rick , forgive me for doing this in notes .
I &apos;m not strong enough to do it in persons .
I realize now that I &apos;m attracted to you for the same reason I can &apos;t be with you .
You can &apos;t change .
And I have no problem with that , but it clearly means I have a problem with myself .
I &apos;m sure there &apos;s no perfect version of me .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll just unify species after species and never really be complete .
But I know how it goes with us .
I lose who I am and become part of you .
Because in a strange way , you &apos;re better at what I do without even trying .
Yours , and nobody else &apos;s , Unity .
P.S. , I don &apos;t know where those coal miners were before they were assimilated .
You might want to get checked .
Hey .
Dad .
I , um Jerry and I were looking for our weed whacker and found your subterranean lair and your alien prisoner , and he got away .
And I know I sound like mom , but I can &apos;t sacrifice this whole family &apos;s safety just because I &apos;m afraid you &apos;ll leave again , so no more alien prisoners and no more subterranean excavation without consulting us .
- Okay .
- Okay ?
&quot; Okay &quot; like you &apos;re gonna quietly teleport somewhere - and never come back ?
- No .
It &apos;s your house .
Grandpa Rick , what happened with Unity ?
Who ?
Oh , Unity .
Yeah , well ...

Where are we , Rick ?
Morty , remember eight seconds ago when when you said , &quot; Go inside what ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; The battery &quot; ?
And then we showed up here , and I wasn &apos;t like , &quot; Whoa , this is unexpected .
This is not what I was expecting , Morty .
- What a <unk> mystery this is . &quot;
- All right , all right .
We &apos;re inside the battery .
I get it .
- You don &apos;t have to bust my balls .
- Huh , this isn &apos;t right .
This <unk> &apos;s supposed to be sending 20 <unk> of juice up to the engine , Morty .
Instead we &apos;ve got ... zero ?
Now what are these people doing ?

It &apos;s time for some <unk> engine repair .
- All right , Morty , hold on to something .
- Whoa !
Holy crap !
I thought we were inside your car battery , Rick .
<unk> is like a whole <unk> or something .
Thanks , Morty .
I &apos;m pretty proud of this bad boy .
Check it out .
I put a <unk> <unk> <unk> inside a <unk> temporal field until a planet developed intelligent life .
I then introduced that life to the wonders of electricity , which they now <unk> on a global scale .
And , you know , some of it goes to power my engine and charge my phone and stuff .
You have a whole planet sitting around making your power for you ?
That &apos;s slavery .
It &apos;s society .
They work for each other , Morty .
They pay each other .
They buy <unk> .
They get married and make children that replace them when they get too old to make power .
That just sounds like slavery with extra steps .
<unk> , someone &apos;s gonna get laid in college .
It appears we are being <unk> by the alien known as Rick , who once gave our world the gift of gooble box technology , which , when <unk> on , generates electricity , powering our homes and <unk> , <unk> our daily lives , while <unk> <unk> the dangerous waste power to a special <unk> <unk> .
But why has Rick returned ?
And what will he say when he hears the big news ?
Let &apos;s find out .
You need to tell these people they &apos;re in a battery , Rick .
It &apos;s messed up .
There &apos;s <unk> down there .

Would you relax , Morty ?
There &apos;s nothing dishonest about what we &apos;re doing .
Now slap on these <unk> .
- These people need to think we &apos;re aliens .

Why ?
Obviously you really know nothing about car repair .
Wait for the ramp , Morty .
They love the slow ramp .
Really gets their dicks hard when they see this ramp just slowly <unk> down .
Greetings !
Morty , you got to flip them off .
I told them it means &quot; Peace among worlds . &quot;
How hilarious is that ?
Coming through .
Two real aliens walking through here .
Rick , our alien friend .
Uh , Mr. President , um , couldn &apos;t help but notice that you were having problems generating power .
That &apos;s correct .
We &apos;ve evolved .
Our most brilliant scientist , Zeep <unk> , has developed a source of energy that makes gooble boxes obsolete .
I would love to see it .

I dropped out of school .
It &apos;s not a place for smart people .
Ohhhh , snap !
Listen to me , you arrogant little-- R-Rick was hoping to see your new energy source .
I think he could learn a lot from you , Zeep .
Fine .
It &apos;s hard for people to grasp , but inside that <unk> is an infinite universe with a planet capable of generating massive <unk> of power .
I call it a miniverse .
Dumb name .
- Excuse me ?
- Nothing .
I mean , it &apos;s hard for us to comprehend all this .
Would it be possible for us to get some kind of tour of your miniverse from the inside ?
This isn &apos;t a &#91; bleep &#93; chocolate factory .
I don &apos;t have time .
Didn &apos;t you say time goes more slowly in the miniverse relative to the real world ?
Yes , Chris .
Thanks for reminding me of that .
Great president .
All right , let &apos;s go .

Hold on to something .
I put an <unk> vacuum inside a temporal field until a world developed .
I then introduced the people of this world to the wonders of electricity in the form of a device I call a flooble crank .
What they don &apos;t know is that <unk> % of every crank &apos;s energy <unk> gets channeled out of the miniverse to be used by us .
No more gooble boxes .

Y-y-you got the people on this world <unk> away making your power .
I mean , that &apos;s what I call slavery .
No , no , no , they work for each other in exchange for money , which they <unk> Well , that just sounds like slavery with extra steps .

My God .
Mr. Smith , shrimply pibbles &apos; life can be saved if we replace his heart with your human penis .
I see .
Wait , what ?
It &apos;s perfect .
The <unk> of <unk> , the ratio of <unk> to <unk> , the delicate <unk> of what you call your balls , and with relatively few <unk> , your genitals can be <unk> into a <unk> heart for the most important man in the universe .

&lt; i &gt; &#91; Monitor beeping &#93; &lt; / i &gt; &#91; Both screaming &#93; &lt; i &gt; Man : Hey , how &apos;s it going ? &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; This is &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; my butthole ice cream <unk> . &lt; / i &gt; I got all kinds of ice cream ... &lt; i &gt; peanut butter and jelly ... &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; &#91; Farts &#93; - ... <unk> ... &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; &#91; Farts &#93; - ... <unk> ... &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; &#91; Farts &#93; - ...

- Dad !
What happened ?
Where am I ?
Was it all a dream ?
No , you were shot like 50 times .
<unk> .
<unk> , you &apos;re in a <unk> alien hospital , so it was basically like getting a <unk> removed .
All ... all I wanted was for everyone to like me .
Jerry , remember that time you left a comment <unk> that YouTube video and someone replied and called you a dumb-ass , so you replied and told them , &quot; it takes one to know one , &quot; and you <unk> up all night hitting &quot; <unk> &quot; on your <unk> waiting for them to <unk> and then you fell asleep crying ?
I remember it differently .
This is like that .
You can &apos;t make people like you .
You just have to wait for hating you to bore them .
You know , you &apos;re right .
I shouldn &apos;t be motivated by other people &apos;s opinions of me .
All right , guys , let &apos;s go home .
If it &apos;s all the same to you , Rick , I &apos;d like to go to the <unk> ... - With my family .
- What ? !
What are you talking about ? !
Why would we do that ? !
It &apos;s a stupid idea !
What &apos;s the matter with you ! ?
Don &apos;t be a piece of shit , Jerry !
Okay , I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;m sorry .
We &apos;ll go home .
What the hell is he talking about ? !
♪ - Aah !
- &lt; i &gt; I &apos;m the eyehole man ! &lt; / i &gt; What is going on ?
Aah !
&lt; i &gt; Give me my eyeholes !
Give me my eyeholes ! &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Give me my eyeholes !
I &apos;m eyehole man !
That part of the <unk> is mine , Jerry ! &lt; / i &gt; Why do you even have those ? !
&lt; i &gt; - Give me my eyeholes ! &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; - Help me , please ! &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Get up on out of here &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; with my eyeholes ! &lt; / i &gt; I got to tell you , Rick .
It &apos;s pretty great to be in this spaceship , just the two of us , you know ?
Just <unk> around , Rick and Morty style .
I agree , Morty .
&#91; Belches &#93; It &apos;s nice to get back to the <unk> after a pretty intense , <unk> of a year .
- Ohh !
- Relax .
That &apos;s what <unk> are for .
I didn &apos;t know that there were bugs out in space .
Well , w-what did you think , Morty ?
Life just developed on earth by itself ?
Here , let me take care of this .
Geez , Rick , that &apos;s disgusting .
I don &apos;t want to look at that .
Yeah , guess I &apos;m out of fluid .
L-let me find a place to stop .
Hey , <unk> , does your planet have wiper fluid yet , or are you gonna freak out and start worshipping us ?
The general store ought to have what you need .
Thanks .
Of course , you &apos;ll be wanting to be gone from here by sundown .
Yeah , sure thing .
Wait a minute .
What ?
Why ?
<unk> is when the festival begins .
The festival ?
Ooh , well , for millennia , our society has been free of crime and war , - living in perfect peace .
- Oh , I know what this is !
You &apos;ve been able to sustain world peace because you have one night a year where you all run around <unk> and murdering each other without <unk> .
- That &apos;s right .
- What ? !
It &apos;s like &quot; the purge , &quot; Morty .
That movie &quot; the purge &quot; ?
Oh , have you been here before ?
No , no , but I &apos;ve been to a few planets with the same gimmick .
You know , sometimes it &apos;s called the cleansing or the red time .
There was this one world that called it just murder night .
I-it &apos;s a purge planet .
They &apos;re peaceful , and then , you know , they just purge .
T-that &apos;s horrible !
Yeah .
You want to check it out ?
♪ &#91; Electricity crackling &#93; So , what do you do during the festival ?
You lock yourself in , or you go out and do some stuff ?
Oh , I do some pretty bad stuff .
Oh , I bet you do , old timer .
&#91; Laughs &#93; Gee ... Rick , come on .
The sun is setting .
W-we got to get out of here .
All right , well , w-what do I owe you for the wiper fluid ?
It &apos;s on the house .
Oh , and , uh , why ... why don &apos;t you have some candy bars , as well ?
Oh , no way .
That &apos;s really nice of you .
I &apos;m a nice guy ... For now .
&#91; Chuckling &#93; Ohh , I don &apos;t doubt it .
- Rick !
- Yeah , yeah .
Hey , have a good festival , old timer .
I <unk> to .
Rick , unlock it !
Just a second , Morty .
Oh , look at that sunset .
Stop screwing around .
&#91; Click &#93; There we go .
Much better .
Now we can see .
Great .
Hey , you know what , Morty ?
Why don &apos;t we <unk> our <unk> windshield here by watching a little of this purge through it ?
What ? !
No !
What is your problem ? !
Morty , grow up .
If you don &apos;t want to watch , don &apos;t watch , but , you know , it &apos;s my car .
&#91; Belches &#93; Also , if you tell your mom about this , - I &apos;ll purge you .
- You &apos;re the worst .
And this planet is the worst .
How can you be into this ?
You know , people are gonna kill each other .
So , what , y-y-you trying to sit here and tell me that &#91; belches &#93; <unk> ... if there &apos;s a video online with someone getting decapitated , - you don &apos;t click on it ?
- No !
Why ... why would I do that ?
&lt; i &gt; You &lt; / i &gt; do that ?
I don &apos;t , because it would bore me .
I see &#91; Bleep &#93; like that for breakfast , Morty .
But if you don &apos;t do it , I say it &apos;s because you &apos;re afraid of your own <unk> <unk> .
So you stuff them down and ... &#91; Bell <unk> &#93; Oh , oh !
Shh .
Shh .
It &apos;s starting .
- <unk> !
Here we go .
- I &apos;m not watching .
Yeah , yeah , yeah , your <unk> &apos;s in the mail .
- I &apos;m gonna get a closer look .
- Oh , okay , sure .
And then someone &apos;s gonna throw a rock and hit the car and then we &apos;re gonna crash and we &apos;re gonna be stuck down there and it &apos;s gonna be what we deserve .
<unk> .
Whoa !
&#91; Indistinct shouting &#93; Whoa , they are purging the &#91; Bleep &#93; out of each other .
&#91; Muffled screaming &#93; Oh , my God !
Oh &#91; Bleep &#93; That was ... okay , yeah .
T-that was gross .
Wow .
Man , I think my eyes were bigger than my stomach on this one , Morty .
Ugh .
My <unk> for <unk> got filled pretty quick .
Oh , God .
&#91; Grunts &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; Woman screaming &#93; Get away from me !
No !
No !
Help !
Somebody help me !
Aah !
All right , Morty .
L-let &apos;s get out of here .
Wait , wait , wait .
Hold on .
W-we have to go down there .
&#91; <unk> &#93; What ?
Why ?
That poor girl .
W-we have to save her .
Uh , Morty , in space , we have something we call the <unk> policy .
We got the wiper fluid .
We watched them kill each other .
We &apos;re leaving .
Help me save that girl , or I &apos;m telling mom you brought me here .
You little turd .
&#91; Screaming &#93; Please !
Leave me alone !
Leave you alone ?
<unk> a purge ?
I don &apos;t think so , baby .
It &apos;s okay .
We &apos;re not gonna hurt you .
My name is Morty .
This is my grandpa .
- We &apos;re <unk> .
- Not anymore .
- Aah !
- Aah !
Oh , my God .
This is &#91; Bleep &#93; awesome !
Morty , this is really cool .
Hey , y-you want to help me out here and kill some people ?
It &apos;s fun .
We &apos;re totally <unk> because we &apos;re saving a little girl .
I mean , w-w-we &apos;re both free and clear to murder these people .
- Are you okay ?
- Yes .
I have to find somewhere to hide .
Well , you can hide with us .
Rick ?
- Yeah ?
- Do you think we could take ... - w-what &apos;s your name ?
- <unk> .
Could we take arthrisha up in the ship and , you know , just wait out the purge ?
Oh , Morty , how can I refuse after all you &apos;ve done to <unk> me ?
Your vehicle ... is it from the gods ?
- No .
- Yes .
So , uh , you know , when the purge started , did people get into it right away , or were they like , &quot; wait , what ? &quot;
This is gonna stop crime how , exactly ? &quot;
Yeah , it took some time for people to accept it .
Yeah , I bet .
&#91; Chuckles &#93; I bet .
Yeah , it &apos;s kind of like cellphones , you know ?
At first , everyone was like , &quot; look at those <unk> purging , &quot; and then the next thing you know , they &apos;re like , &quot; it &apos;s just so convenient . &quot;
Geez , you working on your tight five for the comedy store , Morty ?
Whatcha doing ?
<unk> some TV , playing on your phone ?
- Is that a real question ?
- Just making conversation .
Are you ?
What part of that gives me anything to work with ?
My choice is to say nothing , be sarcastic , or <unk> &quot; yes &quot; like a trained animal .
It &apos;s not a conversation .
You &apos;re holding me verbally hostage .
Okay , <unk> .
I &apos;ll go in the kitchen .
- Hey , dad .
- Yeah ?
Whatcha doing ?
Going into the kitchen ?
Okay .
- Yeah , you like that ?
- Screw you .
So , uh , do most people wear <unk> when they purge ?
I-I don &apos;t want to answer any more purge questions .
All right , hey , hey , that &apos;s cool .
I can roll with that .
&#91; Blowing raspberries &#93; - &#91; Gasps &#93; My Nana !
- Huh ?
My Nana !
We have to save her !
You just now remembered your Nana exists .
I-I was traumatized .
Haven &apos;t you been through like 15 <unk> ?
I mean , some as a child ?
Will somebody just help me get her ?
Fine , whatever .
Morty , stay .
Oh , God .
Oh , crap .
Oh , crap !
- Get out !
Get out !
- Hey , whoa , whoa , whoa !
Get the &#91; Bleep &#93; out of the flying machine !
Oh , my God !

Okay !

- Ohh .
- Back the &#91; Bleep &#93; up !
- Aah !
For what it &apos;s worth , I &apos;m sorry , but that &apos;s not really worth anything tonight , is it ?
Y-you can &apos;t leave us here .
You &apos;re killing us !
You hear me ?
Come back .
Y-you got to come back .
Change your mind .
Oh , geez .
Morty !
Aah !
&#91; Bleep &#93; Amish bitch shot me !
&#91; Grunts &#93; She tried to purge me , Morty .
You let your wiener do the walking , and now I &apos;m dead .
- Rick , she took the car !
- You &#91; Bleep &#93; kidding me , Morty ? !
She took my car and the gun .
We &apos;re like the rest of these assholes now .
W-w-we &apos;re gonna get purged , Morty .
Help me up .
Oh , geez , geez !
Wait a minute , Rick .
Why don &apos;t we just use your portal gun ?
It &apos;s in the car , <unk> .
&#91; Grunts &#93; Oh , God , it hurts .
She got me right in the goddamn liver , Morty .
It &apos;s the <unk> liver in the galaxy , Morty , and now it has a hole in it .
I hope it was worth it .
I was just trying to do right .
Yeah , well , that &apos;s not really the theme of tonight &apos;s party .
<unk> up .
<unk> .
Well , don &apos;t just stand there , Morty .
- Purge &apos; em .
- Me ?
No , me .
Should I rub my liver hole on them ?
Pick up a stick or something and kill them .
- Um , w-we come in peace .
- &#91; Screaming &#93; Oh , my God .
&#91; Grunts &#93; There &apos;s more where that came from !
You want to get purged , you bring it !
Drop &#91; Belches &#93; drop your shit !
Drop it all .
Morty , go get their shit .
Hurry up .
I only had one of those things I threw .
I &apos;m holding a box of <unk> <unk> right now .
- Want some crackers ?
- No , thank you .
Are you ready to be nice to me ?
In exchange for crackers ?
- What happened to you ?
- Dad , get a job .
You &apos;re trying to create drama because you &apos;re bored .
Oh .
&#91; Beeping , whirring &#93; It &apos;s the space phone grandpa gave us .
- Hello ?
- Hey , Summer , it &apos;s grandpa .
I need you to do me a favor .
- I can barely hear you .
- Who is it ?
Morty and I are on a planet that &apos;s purging .
- I need you to take down ... - A plan that &apos;s what ?
We &apos;re on a planet that &apos;s purging , Summer .
<unk> .
We lost our car and my gun , and we &apos;re in a purge .
- Ooh , is it taddi Mason ?
- Like the movie &quot; the purge &quot; ?
Yes , I-I need you to take ... - that movie <unk> .
- Oh , my God .
Hold on .
It &apos;s not taddi Mason ?
Dad , who the &#91; Bleep &#93; is taddi Mason ?
- My friend .
- Aah !
Are you okay ?
I &apos;m putting you on speaker .
- <unk> ?
- Yes , Jerry , it &apos;s taddi , a person no one &apos;s ever heard of until now , calling you on a space phone .
I can &apos;t tell if you &apos;re being sarcastic .
&#91; <unk> &#93; Aah !
&#91; Growling &#93; &#91; Gunshots &#93; <unk> , fast .
Summer , w-we need you to take down this number .
- Quit screwing around .
- Morty ?
Are you all right ?
- No !
- Why are &lt; i &gt; you &lt; / i &gt; with taddi Mason ?
Holy &#91; Bleep &#93; dad !
Shut the &#91; Bleep &#93; up !
Okay .
I guess I &apos;m just this entire family &apos;s toilet paper .
Are you writing this down ?
Will you please write this down ?
- Summer : Yes , yes .
- <unk> ... &#91; Growling &#93; <unk> .
Aah !
&#91; Growling &#93; You son of a bitch !
Morty , I don &apos;t want to be the &quot; a little help &quot; guy , but a little help ?
- Aah !
- Okay , I have a <unk> .
Go .
<unk> <unk> .
A spoon , Morty ?
- A spoon ? !
- I &apos;m sorry .
There &apos;s a pile of <unk> next to you , and you throw me the one thing that can never kill anything ?
All right , okay !
Summer , on the shelf above my <unk> in the garage , there &apos;s a red box with a keypad on it .
You &apos;re gonna take that box outside , and you &apos;re gonna type the number I just gave you into the keypad .
- Got it ?
- Got it .
Is it just part of growing up to hate your dad ?
I &apos;m ignoring you .
Morty , if I can get to the top of that lighthouse , I can send the beacon , and your sister can launch our package .
Just remember , if there &apos;s people in there and they try to purge us , we got to purge them first .
We &apos;re not purging anyone , Rick , all right ?
<unk> you stop it ?
Morty , if we &apos;re gonna survive tonight , you &apos;re gonna need to <unk> your repressed rage .
I don &apos;t have any !
Spoken like a person with repressed rage .
&#91; Doorbell rings &#93; I take no part in the festival .
If you desire to kill me , I only ask you do it quickly .
No such <unk> , chief .
We &apos;re not too <unk> on the purge , either , sir .
We were just hoping to get on the roof of your lighthouse so we can send a beacon to my sister on earth .
- It &apos;s a different planet .
- By the way , life on other planets exists .
Don &apos;t let it distract you .
I &apos;ll let you use my lighthouse for shelter and <unk> on the condition that you listen to my tale .
- Okay .
- Deal .
All right , I &apos;m gonna go to the roof and set things up .
- Morty , you listen to his tale .
- Okay .
&#91; Clears throat &#93; &quot; Fade in .

The <unk> and <unk> is a symphony of progress .
We pan past windows , each of which contain a different story , to find <unk> <unk> , <unk> ... hot , but doesn &apos;t know it .
Jacey stops when her high <unk> gets caught in the <unk> of a sewer .
Suddenly , a man steps into frame and points a gun at her .
This is not her day .
Fade to black .
&quot; Title ... &apos; three weeks earlier . &apos; &quot;
&#91; sighs &#93; You really don &apos;t want to talk to me about this .
Dad , grandpa and Morty are in danger .
You &apos;re unemployed , and you &apos;re bored .
- They &apos;re a higher priority .
- Stop saying I &apos;m unemployed !
Okay , <unk> 2 ... aah !
Good lord !
Now what ?
&#91; Whirring , <unk> &#93; Look , I &apos;m your father , and I love you is all I &apos;m saying .
- I &apos;ll leave it at that .
- Fine , dad !
&#91; Both scream &#93; Oh , he might have said to take it outside .
Rick : Come on , Summer .
How hard is it to type some numbers into a box ?
&lt; i &gt; <unk> locked .
&#91; Device beeps &#93; &lt; / i &gt; Oh , thank God .
Well , I did my job .
Summer did her job .
Now all Morty has to do is finish listening to that tale .
&quot; Blane : Maybe I don &apos;t need a new friend . &quot;
Jacey : Maybe you &apos;re the only friend I need .
Blane : <unk> , or want ?
Jacey : I &apos;ve never been much for wanting .
&quot; Blane : Spoken like someone with needs . &quot;
- Oh , geez .
- Hmm ?
Uh , sorry .
<unk> going .
&quot; Jacey reaches out and <unk> his face . &quot;
It &apos;s clear he needs what she wants .
She &apos;s a woman .
He &apos;s a man .
The city burns in the background as he takes her in his arms .
Fade out .

Do you have any thoughts ?

No .
I-I just <unk> it .
That &apos;s my note , you know ?
Please write more .
- Seems a little <unk> .
- What ?
No .
You don &apos;t have to <unk> me .
I want to <unk> my writing .
Tell me your real thoughts .
All right .
Well , um , I &apos;m not a huge fan , personally , of the whole &quot; three weeks earlier &quot; <unk> thing .
I feel like , you know , we should start our stories where they begin not start them where they get interest ... - get out .
- Um , what ?
No , I &apos;m sick of this .
You <unk> on my door , you beg me to help you , I share something personal with you , and you take a giant shit on it .
Hey , man , we asked if we could put up a beacon ... well , you can &apos;t .
I want you out of here .
You &apos;re a petty person , and you &apos;re insecure , and you &apos;re taking it out on me .
That &apos;s a good <unk> .
What the hell ? !
I don &apos;t care .
I want you out .
- What ?
- Take that thing down .
Your grandson is a shitty person .
Leave now .
- Morty !
- Rick , I didn &apos;t do anything .
I sat through his entire <unk> ... you &quot; sat through it &quot; ?
Yes !
Did you want me to weep with <unk> ?
- It &apos;s terrible !
- Whoa !
Morty !
We &apos;re guests here .
I tried to be a good guest !
He dragged it out of me !
- I &apos;m taking down this beacon .
- No , stop !
That &apos;s not fair !
Just because you hate your own writing doesn &apos;t make me a bad person !
Aah !
You like that ?
You want me to cut to three weeks earlier when you were alive ?
Whoa , Morty .
You just purged .
&lt; i &gt; Beacon <unk> . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; &#91; Device beeps &#93; &lt; / i &gt; Okay , time to go .

What &apos;s the deal here ?
I just wanted to spend some time with my daughter .
You &apos;re growing up so fast .

Remember when we used to go to the <unk> , and I &apos;d push you on the swings ?
Oh , you could push me higher than all the other kids .
You were so small and cute .
I thought you were gonna fly right off into the street .
&#91; Chuckling &#93; I used to pee my pants .
I know , and now look at you !
You have a job .
You &apos;re making really good money .
You &apos;re not paying any rent , so you have plenty of <unk> income .
Oh , God , dad .

Yeah , yeah , I know , a-and nothing does matter .
Obviously , I know that .

You just kill everyone that sees it , and it &apos;s -- and it &apos;s hot under here , <unk> , by the way , is why I shave the beard part .
So , right there , I &apos;m making a decision based on <unk> , which is what I was trying to avoid with the whole bucket over the head because who am I and why am I <unk> myself ?
Why don &apos;t I just wear a tie , right ?
I mean , it &apos;s like that guy you killed when I met you , with the <unk> <unk> on his body .

You seem to alternate between <unk> your own mind as an <unk> force and as an <unk> curse .

The resort &apos;s covered in an immortality field .
You can &apos;t die here .
That &apos;s the gimmick .
Okay , but still ... Bad <unk> .
Hey , rich a-holes are rich a-holes .
They all pay top dollar to come here and enjoy a <unk> vacation .
No death , no disease , no <unk> .
Can &apos;t even have a heart attack .
Got it .
The perfect place to take the most <unk> being in the universe .
I can tell you expect me to <unk> that , but it &apos;s right on the money .
If I come home without you , I doubt Morty &apos;s gonna let me off the hook .
Yeah , but what if you came home with Jeff Goldblum .
Jeff Goldblum ?
What the fuck are you talking about , Jerry ?
Jesus !
Holy fucking shit !
Yo , what &apos;s up , &quot; Big <unk> &quot; ? !
Don &apos;t go into the <unk> !
Hey , maybe we would have fun on a fake adventure .
On a fake adventure .
Speaking of ... What are we gonna tell Morty ?
I don &apos;t know .
But whatever it is , we &apos;re gonna need a couple more of these babies !
What &apos;s wrong ?
Mom , do you think I &apos;m hot ?
I ... don &apos;t think that &apos;s something that matters .
So , I &apos;m not hot ? !
I &apos;m saying the part of you that cares about that is a part you shouldn &apos;t give any energy to .
That &apos;s not an answer !
Because I &apos;m not an issue of <unk> , okay ?
I &apos;m your mother and a doctor , and ...
I &apos;m <unk> !
Geez .
What &apos;s with her ?
<unk> stuff .
Is that a ... <unk> <unk> ?
It &apos;s perfectly <unk> , if that &apos;s what you &apos;re wondering .
Cool ... <unk> .
&quot; We just don &apos;t have anything in common any more , Summer . &quot;
Oh , yeah , Ethan ?
What do you have in common with Tricia Lange ?
A <unk> love of French <unk> ?
The <unk> that a carbon tax is the only <unk> solution to climate change ?
Or could it be her massive <unk> titties ? !
There it is .
<unk> !
And that &apos;s when <unk> the <unk> came , <unk> off his face , and beneath it is my face .
I liked it .
Thank you , sir .
Yeah , of course he likes it .
Look at him .
<unk> got two heads and three trunks .
All right , we &apos;ll put a pin in it .
I &apos;m gonna go take a leak .
What the ... ? !
My hands are dry !
My hands are dry !
My name is Risotto <unk> .
I am the <unk> general manager of the restaurant .
Do you have any comment cards , because I might have some thoughts .
My kingdom was usurped by force with weapons and technology supplied by your father-in-law !
Hey , he usurped my kingdom , too , man .
He basically got me kicked out of my home , stole my family .
Then we are brothers , and you have wondered what your life could have been without Rick .
<unk> ?
Sure .
I mean , I &apos;ve wondered about having a vagina .
Would you help me kill him ?
What ?
No !
He &apos;s my wife &apos;s father .
Move on .
Do you ... like theme-park <unk> ?
Oh , you really moved on .
There is a popular attraction here called the Whirly Dirly .
Between the first whirly and the third <unk> , the ride <unk> just outside the immortality field .
You &apos;re asking me to lure Rick to his death ?
I &apos;m only asking you to go on a ride with Rick , get off the ride without Rick , and go home to your family , where you can ... wonder about having a vagina .
Okay , okay , that was a very specific example pulled from <unk> air .
I don &apos;t want to be known as the vagina guy .
Risotto , you &apos;re needed .
Someone ordered the <unk> <unk> Fresh and <unk> <unk> .
Look , I &apos;m not like Rick , so you &apos;re free to do as you please .
But there comes a time in every man &apos;s life when he must choose the foundation on which his <unk> will be built ... One of compromise or one of blood .
♪ Once a time of year , there &apos;s a special person here ♪ Oh , yeah .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about .
Oops !
Okay , a little more on the other side then .
Oh , come on !
Oh , geez !
Aah !
Stop !
So , the hospital just let you walk right out of there with horse parts in a bag ?
For Christ &apos;s sakes , Morty , women going through a divorce need a creative outlet .
What was that ?
Summer !
I &apos;m coming , Summer !
What the hell happened ? !
How do we get her back to normal ? !
I don &apos;t know , man !
This thing is pretty complicated .
I-I &apos;m gonna call Rick .
Well , hold on .
We can &apos;t just call your grandpa whenever there &apos;s a problem .
We can handle this ourselves .
I mean , I don &apos;t see the point in trying to .
This is obviously Rick-level shit .
I have a medical <unk> .
Is that what this is about ?
<unk> , you want to prove yourself ?
Oh , it &apos;s not about anything , Morty .
How dare you ?
Okay , good .
Then I &apos;ll just call ... Ow !
Morty , I need this .
Hey , Jerry , <unk> trunks here says he knows a place where the ladies drop panties for anyone <unk> .
Yeah , I &apos;m not really interested .
My heart still belongs to Beth .
Oh .
Huh .
Okay .
What , you don &apos;t think I have a shot ?
I didn &apos;t say that .
Excuse me .
May I have another one of these ?
Coming right up .
Hmm , things weren &apos;t always so bad between Beth and me .
We had some good times when we were younger .
Oh , yeah , I bet .
That &apos;s how teenage pregnancy happens , my friend .
Yeah , no .
Things were pretty great , even until a couple of years ago .
Jerry , I get it .
That &apos;s around the time I moved in with you guys .
Oh , I guess you &apos;re right .
Jerry , you know , I hope you &apos;re not suggesting that I had anything to do with your marriage breaking up , because there are some <unk> issues between you and Beth that have been there since you guys met .
Hey , to new <unk> .
To the Whirly Dirly .
The Whirly Dirly ?
All right , what &apos;s going on here ?
When did you get cool ? !
When you stole my wife !
I should have done that a long time ago !
We &apos;re going on the Whirly Dirly !
Whirly Dirly , baby .
Aha , look at this .
It says &quot; normalize . &quot;
I bet if we just press that ...
But ... if the machine was made by spider people , normal would mean eight legs .
Oh , God !
Are you gonna go on another <unk> like you did with the <unk> crayon ?
I &apos;m pretty sure &quot; normalize &quot; will make her normal .
Aah !
I &apos;d call that progress .
She &apos;s huge !
And normal !
I &apos;m not normal !
Mom !
Okay , this says &quot; reverse . &quot;
<unk> and done .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
Oh , come on !
What else could &quot; reverse &quot; possibly mean ?
Aah !
Mom , call Rick !
Thank you .
There &apos;s a <unk> number on here .
Mom !
Oh , man .
This is gonna be awesome !
I got to hand it to you , Jerry .
This was a solid idea .
Uh , yeah .
Uh-huh .
And you know what ?
I &apos;ll cop to it .
I put a lot of strain on your marriage .
It wasn &apos;t fair .
I &apos;m sorry .
What ? !
I didn &apos;t respect your marriage .
I certainly didn &apos;t do it any favors .
And for what it &apos;s worth , I &apos;ll apologize to Beth for it when we get home .
Whoo !
Whirly Dirly !
Yeah !
Stop the ride !
We got to get off .
What are you talking about , buddy ?
We got to get out of this thing .
We got to get out !
Jerry , come on , man !
We haven &apos;t even gotten to the first whirly .
No , no , this sucks .
It &apos;s so boring .
I mean , I &apos;m falling asleep here .
Let &apos;s just get out and crawl down the sides .
Uh , get down !
Duck down !
It &apos;s more fun when you <unk> down .
Jerry , what the ... Oh shit !
Rick , up here !
There &apos;s a spot where you can kill him !
Good call , Jerry !
Hey , how &apos;d you know about that ?
Uh ... <unk> ?
So , uh , Jerry , big fan of the Whirly Dirly , are you ?
Not anymore .
Obviously .
But when you were , how did you know about it ?
We had a deal , Jerry Smith .
It &apos;s a really common name .
Now , take it easy , Rick .
You &apos;ve been in a serious <unk> crash .
It &apos;s ...
It &apos;s no time to be thinking about who did or didn &apos;t play a role in your <unk> murder .
Get it off me !
It &apos;s eating me !
Look , I <unk> , okay ?
They told me about all the bad stuff you did to this planet and <unk> me of all the bad stuff you did to me .
But then you said you were sorry , and I realized you &apos;re not a monster ... Not like this thing .
<unk> It &apos;s got me good .
This is a <unk> , right ?
You &apos;re inventing a thing to save me .
That would be called a knife , Jerry .
It &apos;s been invented .
I &apos;m making a way out of here ... One seat ought to do it .
I &apos;m sorry .
I-I made a mistake .
I won &apos;t do it again !
Nobody ever does .
You <unk> piece of shit .
You took my family !
I took your family ?
Who do you think had more taken from them when you shot 20 <unk> of liquid <unk> into my daughter ?
She was Rick &apos;s daughter , Jerry .
She had options !
Oof .
That all ended because she felt sorry for you .
You act like prey , but you &apos;re a predator !
You use pity to lure in your victims !
That &apos;s how you survive !
I survive because I know everything .
That snakes <unk> because children wander off , and you survive because people think , &quot; Oh , this poor piece of shit .
He never gets a break . &quot;
I can &apos;t stand the <unk> silent wails of his <unk> soul .
&quot; I guess I &apos;ll <unk> him or marry him . &quot;
- Rick !
- Rick !
I knew you wouldn &apos;t let me die .
That was never an option .
Because you never had a son .
No , because I need a living <unk> <unk> in <unk> snake <unk> to attract a <unk> <unk> .
Wait , what &apos;s happening ?
Use that confusion , Jerry .
It &apos;ll make you <unk> more like an abandoned <unk> .
Jesus Christ !
What the fuck Rick ? !
Help !
Help me !
Aaah !
There &apos;s a space <unk> 20 miles south .
We &apos;ll be able to board a galaxy class <unk> ship and jump through a wormhole that will put us within <unk> distance of the <unk> Way .
But , hey , it &apos;s about the journey , not the destination , right , Jerry ?
Just stay put , sweetie !
Mom &apos;s still on hold .
<unk> customer service .
How may I help you ?
Yes , I &apos;m having a little trouble with one of your machines .
Oh , I &apos;m sorry to hear that , ma &apos;am .
Do you see a little <unk> on the side of the machine ?
Let me check .
Yes , got it .
Mom ?
Great !
Now , do you see the little button next to it ?
I do .
Give that button a push .
Okay .
Mom , listen to me !
We &apos;re free ! !
Okay , so I pushed the button , and three little men ran out .
What do I do next ?
Hello ?
I think we got <unk> .
Morty !
Don &apos;t &quot; Morty &quot; me !
I <unk> Rick into taking Dad on an adventure because I thought I could get a break from this kind of shit but no !
Like father , like Goddamn daughter !
You want to be like Rick , <unk> !
You &apos;re just as arrogant and just as irresponsible !
Everything okay here ?
Mind your own Goddamn business , Gene !
I &apos;m having a conversation with my mother here !
<unk> Rick &apos;s ass isn &apos;t gonna help him keep him around , Mom , but it will help you lose everyone else .
Like I lost Summer .
Hey , you haven &apos;t lost her yet .
No , I definitely did .
She &apos;s gone .
God damn it !
Go ahead .
Oh , come on .
What &apos;s happening ?
Your friend is class C or above <unk> augmentations .
<unk> on the above .
In any case , he needs to be <unk> .
What ? !
Wait !
Ugh !
<unk> <unk> .
What did you do ?
It &apos;s a synaptic dampener that <unk> violent tendencies and controversial thought .
He will now be an ideal passenger .
I want cookies and a <unk> cut of &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Seriously ?
Quit it .
It &apos;ll wear off in six hours .
It &apos;s <unk> than <unk> dangerous people from <unk> .
I mean , let everybody buy a ticket , right ?
Otherwise , the terrorists win .
Aah !
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;m not a classic <unk> <unk> .
Okay , I don &apos;t know what to do when you people come to me with your weird puberty issues .
What are you gonna do when your daughter asks you if she &apos;s attractive ?
I &apos;ll say &quot; yes &quot; !
Morty , gross !
Well , she &apos;s gonna be super hot .
<unk> mother &apos;s gonna be Jessica ...
Wait , when did Summer ask you that ? !
Right before she <unk> <unk> herself .
Why ?
Wait , I know where she is !
Ethan and Summer were supposed to go <unk> , and then he dumped Summer for this girl , Tricia Lange , who &apos;s got huge boobies and took her .
<unk> ...
The one with the name that sounds like somebody gave up halfway through naming it .
Uh ... <unk> <unk> !
Mama &apos;s coming , baby .
Mama &apos;s coming , and she cares about your titties !
They have sweet <unk> honey cookies .
Mmm !
And <unk> <unk> flakes .
Obviously cookies .
Let &apos;s get you the flakes then .
Okay , but it &apos;s not what I wanted .
Well , maybe next time , you won &apos;t be such a dumb piece of shit and you can pick for yourself .
That &apos;s not nice .
What &apos;s that ?
Did you just have a controversial thought ?
No .
That &apos;s what I thought , bitch .
You little punk-ass .
This is the best .
I agree .
You &apos;ve made things even easier than if you hadn &apos;t been <unk> .
Uh-oh .
We get <unk> now .
All right , folks , if you could please take your <unk> , we &apos;re about to enter the wormhole .
So , I hope everybody bought it dinner first .
Nice .
Nice .
Jerry , step over there and lock yourself in the escape <unk> .
You &apos;re not killing us ?
I &apos;m killing Rick .
You &apos;re free to go .
You &apos;re no threat to me or anyone .
Now you &apos;re just being mean .
Yeah , you &apos;re mean ... No offense .
Mean would be shooting you , Jerry .
This is saving a bullet .
Go back to your quietly ashamed family and live out the rest of your days in denial of your vagina fantasies .
It was a <unk> thought that everyone has !
What are you doing ?
I &apos;m being <unk> brave !
It &apos;s not <unk> or brave .
You &apos;re not <unk> anything .
You might shoot me .
I think you know I won &apos;t .
Because you know I feel sorry for you .
You &apos;re just doing this so you can tell yourself you fought ... Ow !
<unk> shield compromised .
Congratulations , Jerry .
You get to die a man .
Uh , that &apos;s okay !
I &apos;ll leave !
Please don &apos;t shoot .
I-I &apos;m the vagina guy , remember ?
Whoa !
What is happening to me ?
Where is this ?
Where am I ?
Am I dead ?
<unk> I ... Am I still alive ?
Those aren &apos;t the questions you should be asking .
Huh ? !
Shh !
Ah , got ya !
Come here , you little pumpkin .
I have shit on my ass .
Whoa , <unk> this !
Who am I ?
Who am I ?
I &apos;m time !
I &apos;m literally time !
<unk> !
Aah !
Oh , God .
I feel like our souls were united , and we were all one with eternity .
Our body &apos;s <unk> , yet our minds have lived a thousand <unk> .
Is that enough time for me to forgive you ?
I don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s enough time for a synaptic dampener to wear off .
He hadn &apos;t decided he was still going to kill us !
He was talking himself into it .
I &apos;ve seen it before .
<unk> <unk> wears off faster than <unk> .
I &apos;m starting to believe you because I just finished merging with your <unk> for an endless epoch , and I &apos;m already back to thinking you &apos;re an asshole .
Fine with me .
Let &apos;s just go our <unk> ways .
Sounds like you and the word &quot; epoch &quot; have a lot of catching up to do .
Wait , don &apos;t leave me !
All right , folks , you &apos;re free to get up and walk around the cabin and maybe take the wormhole out for breakfast .
Okay , you can do the dinner one or the breakfast one , but not both .
You think you got that thing figured out ?
Yeah , I know what I &apos;m doing .
Good .
Because I have an idea .
It &apos;s actually a <unk> of &quot; some &quot; and &quot; more , &quot; you see that ?
Oh , wow .
I was way off .
Morty , what &apos;s happening here ?
Summer got into my grandpa &apos;s garage , messed around , and turned herself into a monster .
My mom did the same to make her feel better .
She &apos;s a good mom .
Oh , my God .
I have to go call my mother !
Tricia , wait !
Ethan !
Ethan !
Hey , it &apos;s okay .
Sit down .
You made my sister cry , Ethan .
You messed with her body <unk> .
Look , Morty , I ... Shh , shh , shh .
Careful , Ethan .
Your s <unk> is burning .
Uh , I guess we better get on the same page about our fake adventure .
Right .
I &apos;ll make you a deal .
I &apos;ll leave out the part where you tried to murder me ... And I &apos;ll leave out the part where you <unk> to <unk> our marriage .
You want to ... ?
Nah , if the family sees me like this , they &apos;ll feel sorry for me .
Which is no longer my <unk> move .
Later days , <unk> .
Actually , I just realized , I don &apos;t have my wallet , and my <unk> pass is in there , so maybe ... Stay strong , Jerry .
I believe in you !
I tell you , fellas .
This is the life .
It certainly is .
To freedom !
Ooh !
Looks like a <unk> .
Ooh , a couple cranks on scaling <unk> with a four <unk> cross fade would fix that in a <unk> .
Four ?
You &apos;d be lucky to clear <unk> % <unk> with that kind of range .
Gentlemen , gentlemen , what did we agree on ?
No work talk !
Let &apos;s just relax and enjoy our <unk> , shall ... Oh , my God !
Aaah !
So , Jessica , I heard you broke up with Brad .
Who are you gonna date now that you can date anyone ?
I don &apos;t know .
I mean , obviously if someone special comes along ... <unk> I mean &lt; i &gt; really &lt; / i &gt; special , like , nothing I &apos;ve even remotely considered in the past .
Holy shit , holy shit , holy shit .
I want that kind of love like that <unk> kind of love .
Oh , yeah .
Like , penis in the <unk> kind of love ... Mm-hmm ... just , like , <unk> , just like ...
He ... Everybody &#91; bleep &#93; off .
Morty , I need your help .
W-W-W-We ... We need to go on a quick adventure .
You said I could go to school today .
That was before I needed something , Morty .
There &apos;s a plasma <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> has it .
If I get it , I &apos;ll be awesome .
We &apos;ve been going non-stop , Rick .
It &apos;s not healthy .
You know , these are my teenage years .
I-I just found out Jessica &apos;s single .
Oh , that &apos;s ... Wow , Morty .
Wow .
What an exciting life you lead .
Let &apos;s go .
In and out , 20 minutes adventure .
They &apos;re on our tail !
Steady , Morty .
Five cetons .
Steady , God damn it !
Two cetons .
Wha !
<unk> !
Pull up , Morty , pull up !
Pull up !
&#91; Bleep &#93; Oh , &#91; Bleep &#93; &#91; Bleep &#93; Ahh !
Ahh !
I can &apos;t &#91; bleep &#93; do this anymore !
That was seriously &#91; bleep &#93; up .
We almost died .
So you agree ?
&#91; Bleep &#93; yes !
That w ... <unk> was insane !
That was <unk> luck .
I was not in control of that situation at all .
Look at this , Morty .
Look at my &#91; bleep &#93; hand .
Look at this shit .
Why do you keep doing this to us ? !
I don &apos;t know , Morty .
Maybe I hate myself , maybe I think I deserve to die .
I-I-I-I don &apos;t ...
I don &apos;t know !
We need a vacation .
Isn &apos;t that something ?
You were right ... Best day spa in the galaxy .
It &apos;s not even cruel , either .
These things are just doing what they do in the wild ...
It loves swallowing <unk> creatures for 20 minutes and then <unk> them up .
My whole body &apos;s like a baby &apos;s ass .
<unk> <unk> detox ?
<unk> all your <unk> toxins , <unk> your system .
Oof , this guy on commission or something ?
I don &apos;t think ... Are you on commission ?
We &apos;re not on commission .
We get paid by the hour .
There &apos;s no incentive really ... Oh , my God .
Okay , listen ... W-W-W-We &apos;ll try the machine , but ... but I &apos;d like you to try something .
Try swallowing the giant ball of <unk> that &apos;s <unk> around in the back of your throat .
It &apos;s disgusting .
Nobody wants to hear that .
That &apos;s what you do .
Okay , Rick , come on .
Enough .
Man , did you hear me bite that guy &apos;s head off ?
Geez , I really need to chill .
Maybe you should go through twice .
All right , mister comedy man , you don &apos;t have to bust my balls .
You &apos;re not helping things .
Rick , is this thing supposed to be making this ... Morty !
- <unk> ... - Morty !
What happened ?
We blew up , idiot !
Are you really that stupid ?
Obviously the guy I <unk> at <unk> the machine .
It takes more than that to kill Rick and Morty , mother &#91; bleep &#93; !
But this might do it .
Run , Morty !
<unk> hurts !
That &apos;s because you &apos;re worthless !
Jesus , how big was this <unk> ?
I &apos;m a genius .
I don &apos;t have time for this &#91; bleep &#93; .
<unk> &apos;re in Hell , aren &apos;t we , Rick ?
- You &apos;re so stupid , Morty .
- You &apos;re an idiot .
There &apos;s no such thing as Hell .
I believe you , but I just want to die .
You can die when I say so .
I control you .
I control the universe !
Why am I bragging about that ?
I have nothing to prove .
I &apos;m surrounded by inferior pieces of &#91; bleep &#93; and ... <unk> .
We &apos;re not in Hell , Morty .
We &apos;re in the detoxifier .
The machine didn &apos;t blow up .
It worked normally .
It removed our toxins .
&lt; i &gt; We &apos;re &lt; / i &gt; the toxins .
Are you listening , you stupid little garbage person ? !
We &apos;re what got removed ! !
I hope you both found that detox <unk> <unk> .
Hey , man , listen ... Those comments I made about your throat ?
It &apos;s all good .
It &apos;s nice of you to let me off the hook .
It &apos;s still unacceptable behavior , and I do regret it .
Believe me , man , I &apos;ve been working here a long time .
I get it .
Hey , uh , you mind if I put on some music ?
Not at all .
♪ Grab my <unk> ♪ What is that ?
I just hit shuffle .
Are you kidding ?
- This universe .
- Oh , excuse me .
We should listen to one random song a day , you know ?
We &apos;d end up hearing more songs we didn &apos;t like , but we &apos;d discover a lot more that we did .
That is an interesting concept .
You know , it makes me wonder if there &apos;s an <unk> expression that could achieve the ideal ratio .
Listen to me ...
Trying to <unk> happiness over here .
<unk> , if anyone could , Rick .
Hey , here &apos;s something no science could measure ...
I &apos;m real proud to be your grandpa , Morty .
Thanks , Rick .
I love you .
Yeah , mother &#91; bleep &#93; !
Yeah !
Get it !
Get some !
Right up your &#91; bleep &#93; bitch ass , you &#91; bleep &#93; !
Guess who just discovered a new element ? !
You think you could do that , Morty ?
You think anyone but me could do that ever in a billion years ?
Do you think if God existed he could do it ?
The answer is no .
If God exists , it &apos;s &#91; bleep &#93; me .
Yes , Rick .
I-I agree , Rick .
While you were <unk> your <unk> turd holster , I discovered the toxic equivalent of electricity , Morty .
What do you think about that ?
Uh ...
I th ...
I think my voice is annoying .
It is , &lt; i &gt; and &lt; / i &gt; it &apos;s your best quality .
So true .
Now , who can tell me the common denominator of these two <unk> ?
You don &apos;t know or y &apos;all just bored ?
Hey , listen , you know , <unk> ...
If we &apos;re all bored over here , wouldn &apos;t the common denominator be you ?
Damn , Morty .
That &apos;s hilarious .
Normally I would come down on any kind of <unk> , but it seems to represent a <unk> change for your character .
Class dismissed !
- Awesome , Morty !
- You done good , Morty .
Oh , yeah !
Thanks for the advice , Morty .
You got it .
I did it , Morty !
I knew you could .
Hey , Morty , remember <unk> when I couldn &apos;t play the <unk> ?
Well , check this out !
Just like I told you , <unk> ...
The music was in your heart the whole time .
Stupid hat ...
Wish I had the <unk> to just be myself .
There you are .
You might have all these idiots <unk> , but I know you &apos;re still the same pathetic loser hiding behind a confident <unk> .
I know that because ...
I &apos;m doing the same thing , brother .
I &apos;m not alone anymore !
Hey , Morty .
Word around school is you &apos;ve become super healthy .
I don &apos;t know about all that .
I do , however , know that I have a pretty bad case of haven &apos;t taken you to <unk> .
<unk> be fatal .
Hey , kids .
Uh , hope I &apos;m not interrupting .
Morty , a moment of your time ?
Happy to help , Rick .
I hate to bug you with this , but after our morning hike I started <unk> very <unk> , highly <unk> <unk> on my <unk> <unk> phone .
Listen .
It &apos;s a bad phone .
<unk> it .
I downgraded to a <unk> for <unk> only .
You know , if ... if ... if something &apos;s worth saying , I-it &apos;s worth eye contact .
Uh , I-I-I <unk> the source of the call back to the spa we went to , Morty .
I thought I could hear a voice in there , so I <unk> it , a-and listen .
Hey , asshole !
Oh , man !
Remember us ?
Oh , I don &apos;t like <unk> !
You &#91; bleep &#93; us , you pieces of garbage !
That &apos;s right , you &apos;re &#91; bleep &#93; garbage , not us .
I &apos;m a &#91; bleep &#93; genius and a god .
You really think this thing can hold me ?
I &apos;m gonna rip your throat ... Morty , what if the toxic parts of us have their own <unk> , their own will to live ?
W-What if mine shares my intelligence and <unk> a way to reach out to us ?
Sounds like he &apos;s in a lot of pain .
<unk> .
<unk>
<unk> .
But , you know , you shouldn &apos;t have to deal with that , man .
You know , l-let &apos;s work off your <unk> with some urban <unk> yoga .
It &apos;s amazing .
You do yoga on a bike , but you have an <unk> <unk> ...
I don &apos;t think I can just blow this off , Morty .
If I had known it worked this way , I wouldn &apos;t have detoxed .
Well , I would have because I was toxic .
Now I &apos;m detoxed and I &apos;m accountable to my toxins , right ?
I-It &apos;s a <unk> .
I think I know what to do .
Morty !
Rick !
You know , the only problem here is a big fat brain that <unk> eating all them big fat problems .
Focus on the good thing .
Trust me , things are good .
Taking that away from me ... ... that wouldn &apos;t be healthy .
Oh , man .
World &apos;s <unk> Grandpa , for <unk> .
It &apos;s not just a coffee cup for you , <unk> .
You &apos;re legit .
I love drums .
I never took drum <unk> .
Why ?

We are <unk> to our own <unk> .
How amazing is that ?
Is the <unk> prepared in the kitchen ?
I &apos;ll have a water .
Uh ... How is the ...
&quot; <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> .
It &apos;s a cup of <unk> sticks .
Ha !
It &apos;s okay !

Words are just things .
Please .
Thank you .
We &apos;re having a conversation .
God , I am so excited to finally have dinner with you .
You know how long I &apos;ve been waiting for this ?
It &apos;s like , <unk> !
I-I-I wish you &apos;d shut up , though .
Just kidding .
You know , you &apos;re so quiet .
What &apos;s wrong ?
<unk> don &apos;t you tell me about yourself ?
What &apos;s the atmosphere like on planet Jessica ?
Where &apos;s the <unk> , what are the <unk> , a-and the <unk> ?
I mean , you know , are they the same time ?
Talk to me .
Well ...
I ... like this restaurant .
Holy &#91; bleep &#93; !
Holy &#91; bleep &#93; !
We have a moron over here !
I &apos;m an idiot .
I can &apos;t believe I haven &apos;t thought of this .
You have to do this detox thing I did .
It &apos;s an alien spa , you go through it , <unk> , lasers , <unk> ... ... sucks everything out .
Everything that was holding me back , everything bad , I mean , it just ...
Right ?
<unk> .
Oh , my God !
I can &apos;t believe this .
Yeah , phones are <unk> , I downgraded to ...
I totally forgot my ...
I have a ... thing , and ...
Things are good .
You know what ?
Why am I doing that ?
That &apos;s more rude than the truth .
Look , I &apos;m sorry , Morty .
I just don &apos;t think ... Do not .
Even .
You have no need to explain .
It &apos;s all good .
I think you &apos;d get bored with me .
<unk> .
Look , the sparks aren &apos;t flying .
This is what dating is for , you know ?
First date , no sparks .
No damage , no <unk> .
Life is a <unk> .
We &apos;re gonna ride it all night <unk> !
<unk> eat some &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Mmm !
Is this organic ?
Mmm .
All right .
You know , the <unk> continues .
Okay , here we go .
Ma &apos;am , I &apos;m afraid I have some bad news for you .
Your money &apos;s no good here .
I &apos;ll ...
I &apos;ll get the next round , sir .
Aren &apos;t you a child ?
Only in the ways that matter .
Morty .
Stacy .
I &apos;ve been watching you drink , Stacy .
I get the feeling you &apos;ve got a hard job .
I wonder what it takes to please you .
That &apos;s the job I want ... Part time , full time , I want to be good at it , bad at it , I want to get promoted , fired , corner office , hostile <unk> , <unk> accident ...
I &apos;m on my knees , Stacy ... <unk> , worshipping , <unk> , whatever you want .
What do you think about that ?
Okay .
&#91; Bleep &#93; it .
<unk> .
Mm !
Let &apos;s ask my grandpa .
He &apos;s a scientist .
Hey , Rick , are you familiar with &quot; <unk> Wa &quot; technology ?
Morty , great news .
I went back to the spa and they let me purchase the <unk> <unk> from their detoxifier .
Why ?
Because we &apos;re coming home , bitch !
What is this ?
This is the parts of your pussy grandpa that keep it real .
Oh ... oh , and I think you dropped something , too !
I don &apos;t want to be on camera .
I &apos;m ugly and gross , please .
Should I go ?
You &apos;re your own person , Stacy .
Then I &apos;d like to stay .
Rick , please tell me you &apos;re not trying to put that stuff back inside of us .
Morty , I &apos;m sorry .
That stuff is alive and it belongs with us .
We <unk> them from their homes and locked them in a can .
Mother &#91; bleep &#93; !
See ?
They &apos;re living in pain .
That &apos;s what they do , Rick , they live in pain .
They &lt; i &gt; are &lt; / i &gt; pain , you know ?
They ... they &apos;re all the bad parts of us , which , by the way , includes our <unk> , so how do you know this isn &apos;t all some sort of crazy trick ?
Oh , so now because I &apos;m made entirely of toxins I &apos;m also a liar ?
&#91; Bleep &#93; you , you little sociopath .
You hear this , Morty ?
Oh , everybody hates me .
I can tell .
Y-You all hate me ... All right , shut up , Morty .
<unk> Rick , are we doing this or what ?
Yep .
Sorry , Morty .
I need you to step into the booth .
Don &apos;t negotiate with that little turd , dummy .
You &apos;re the Rick .
You need to show <unk> .
Morty , booth , now .
<unk> !
Come on , Morty .
Don &apos;t touch me !
Morty , do the healthy thing and <unk> <unk> yourself .
Nooooo !
Is it wrong if I think this is kind of hot ?
Let me out of here !
Stacy , help !
Open the door !
I need to hear our safe word , Morty .
Sea Cucumber !
Sea Cucumber !
What are you doing ?
I &apos;ll do anything for you , Morty .
No !
It worked !
Yes !
That idiot believed every word .
Now let &apos;s see how &lt; i &gt; he &lt; / i &gt; <unk> living in that shit tank .
He &apos;s right behind me , isn &apos;t he ?
He &apos;s in &lt; i &gt; front &lt; / i &gt; of you .
Oh .
My eyes are still <unk> .
Uh , is this like a sex dungeon ?
I guess I should &apos;ve been paying attention .
After 70 years of being bottled up inside a <unk> jackass , I finally get to live my own life .
You said we were merging .
I lied , dumbass !
I lie about everything !
Why would I ever re-merge with a pussy like you ?
So ... you were just gonna trap us in that tank ?
<unk> was your plan ?
Not &lt; i &gt; was , &lt; / i &gt; mother &#91; bleep &#93; ... still is .
... Kill him , Rick !
I don &apos;t like this !
This is scary !
All right , you asked for it .
Did I ask for this ?
Did I ask for this ?
Huh ?
Did I ?
&lt; i &gt; <unk> threat to groin . &lt; / i &gt; <unk> System <unk> .
Kill him !
&lt; i &gt; That ... is my groin &apos;s <unk> . &lt; / i &gt; Believe me , I got a lot more use out of that thing than he ever did .
&lt; i &gt; You know what ?
Not my table . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; You &lt; / i &gt; do &lt; i &gt; know me . &lt; / i &gt; What the hell , Grandpa Rick ?
&#91; Bleep &#93; you , Summer !
Sorry , Summer !
Okay , okay , take it easy .
Don &apos;t do it .
I love you .
Good boy .
Daddy &apos;s little boy .
Summer , get out of here !
Go !
Oh , who &apos;s that ?
Who &apos;s that over there ?
Oh , no .
You see the bad man in front of you ?
You &apos;re a good little boy , you &apos;re gonna get him .
You &apos;re gonna get him .
Ahh !
Son of a ... Ahh !
Nice try , asshole .
We can <unk> our issues .
We don &apos;t need to resort to <unk> ... Aah !
I-I did it , Rick .
I got the tank !
I-I &apos;m a piece of &#91; bleep &#93; , but I got the tank !
You &apos;re going in that tank , mother &#91; bleep &#93; .
You &apos;re gonna live in that toxic &#91; bleep &#93; wasteland like I had to do !
Ahh !
Ow !
That &apos;s right , mother ... You &apos;re going in that &#91; bleep &#93; ... <unk> ?
Okay , just ... Just leave her out of it .
What &apos;s going on ?
All right , &#91; bleep &#93; this .
Time for plan <unk> ...
If I can &apos;t trap you in a toxic world , I &apos;ll just make the whole world toxic .
It &apos;s okay , girls .
I-I &apos;m so sorry I put us in danger with some of my behavior .
<unk> you &apos;d like I can go out in the <unk> , pick some fresh <unk> , and make us a nice <unk> .
What did the <unk> version of you mean when he said he was going to make the whole world toxic ?
Believe me , sweetie , that man &apos;s <unk> are a mystery .
Screw that , Rick .
We got to stop him .
What &apos;s the last thing you &apos;d think about doing with that tank thing ?
Morty , I appreciate what you &apos;re trying to do , but it &apos;s not our place , you know , to pick and choose which world gets saved from what <unk> .
Our ... our toxins have as much a right to their <unk> as ... Morty , how is it healthy to slap me ?
Obviously my version of health is a hell of a lot different from yours , you useless old turd .
Wait .
That &apos;s it .
How could that detox machine know the difference between healthy and sick for everything that goes through it ?
It can &apos;t .
It must be by the individual &apos;s own definition of toxicity .
That means ... Dad !
What the ... What the hell , Rick ?
I &apos;ll explain on the way .
This &quot; Moon Tower , &quot; Morty , is the perfect height and <unk> composition for the <unk> and <unk> of toxic <unk> .
What do you think about that , Morty ?
Are you excited about that , Morty ?
Oh , man .
I &apos;m just <unk> out .
I-It &apos;s too high up here .
Once I flip this switch , the entire world is gonna be just as toxic as us , baby .
As we praise our loving Father ... God is a lie !
We made him up for money !
Santa Claus isn &apos;t real .
You were all mistakes !
We &#91; bleep &#93; did it , Morty .
Put your &#91; bleep &#93; hands in the air .
Yeah , you little piece of &#91; bleep &#93; .
Remember me ?
Didn &apos;t you learn last time that you can &apos;t beat me ?
Yeah , I did .
And then I learned something else .
- This .
- Ahh ! !
That bullet is laced with an <unk> <unk> virus that will disintegrate your Morty in about , ah , 20 minutes .
You think I give a &#91; bleep &#93; ?
I know you give a &#91; bleep &#93; , dummy .
Because I know I don &apos;t .
Here &apos;s another thing I know ...
The <unk> key that <unk> the virus .
You want it ?
Come and get it .
<unk> with me and you &apos;ll know how to save him .
Pfft .
Come on , man .
I &apos;ve been trapped in your pussy brain for 70 years of <unk> , but this is the <unk> <unk> bluff that I &apos;ve ever ...
<unk> ! !
Jesus Christ !
What are you doing ? !
He &apos;s cutting your time in half .
10 minutes .
Ohh !
It hurts !
What is your problem ?
Oh , I had all my problems removed ... my <unk> , my <unk> , my <unk> <unk> , my irrational <unk> .
They must be somewhere .
They ain &apos;t over here , bro .
I &apos;m not going back in there !
Honestly , I don &apos;t care either way .
I hate having you in me .
And when I say &quot; honestly &quot; you can believe it , because we both know I &apos;m too healthy to lie .
Watch .
All right !
Knock it off !
You &apos;re not <unk> anyone .
Morty , not that I give a &#91; bleep &#93; , but are you okay ?
Jesus Christ , it hurts .
Relax , quit your <unk> .
Y-You &apos;re gonna be fine .
Grandpa &apos;s here .
You think that &apos;s funny ?
Y-You got to have a sense of <unk> about these things .
Oh , wait , you can &apos;t .
You &apos;re literally incapable of seeing the bigger picture .
I guess it &apos;s just funny because you &apos;ve never done anything but <unk> about me being in charge , but if I ever gave you the wheel we &apos;d be dead in five minutes .
- Rick ?
- You poor , dumb , sick animal .
Rick ?
Ahh !
Just do it !
Just do it , you piece of ...
I &apos;m back , baby !
Regular Rick !
Master of both worlds !
Check it it out !
&quot; Excuse me . &quot;
Now we &apos;ll just reverse this <unk> toxicity beam .
Man , I really over think shit when I &apos;m angry .
Oh , give it to me .
Mm , <unk> .
God is &lt; i &gt; not &lt; / i &gt; a lie .
Mommy !
Mommy !
Ha !
All right , Morty , now it &apos;s time we re-merge your little ass .
You &apos;re a better man than me , Rick .
I &apos;m healthy enough to admit that !
That kid is a real piece of &#91; bleep &#93; .
Y-Y-You &apos;re gonna save me , right ?
Part of me wanted to , <unk> Morty .
Part of me really wanted to .
I &apos;m telling you , these shares are hot .
Yeah .
That sounds like a good idea .
It &apos;s definitely a good idea .
Duane , Duane , Duane , I get it , now can you get me ?
Have I ever lied to you ?
That &apos;s right , and ask around , I never do , Duane .
Let me put this real simple .
This stock is a beautiful <unk> , recently single , not looking to date but ready to fall in love , and fate has put her locker two down from yours , Duane ... Two <unk> down .
So step up or step off , Duane .
<unk> pill or red pill , what &apos;ll be , bro ?
Totally understand , Duane .
You &apos;re the boss .
<unk> <unk> ... Million and a half at <unk> .
<unk> .
You little &#91; bleep &#93; monster .
Mmm !
Is this organic ?
Mmm !
Go for Morty .
Hi , Morty .
It &apos;s Jessica .
Look , can we just talk for a minute ?
Is that how long it takes for Rick to trace my location ?
Come back , Morty .
I miss you .
You miss the old me .
You miss someone that loved you so much you never had to love &apos; em back .
How do you know I don &apos;t want to love you ?
Because I &apos;m not sick .
<unk> ?
Should I be jealous ?
There &apos;s nothing to be jealous of .
I just realized that I &apos;m scheduled to speak at that fundraiser on our date night .
I can cancel .
We &apos;ll be together .
That &apos;s a date .
You are the perfect man .
Oh , sweetie , I think you hit the wrong button .
You didn &apos;t hang up .
Huh .
How &apos; <unk> that ?
Sorry , tiny American <unk> , time to take the opposite of your medicine .
Do what you got to do .
Oh !
Ow !
Ahh !
So , how do you feel , Morty ?
Ah , geez .
I &apos;m miserable .
Am I good or what ?
I guess it &apos;s worth it , though , to know how much you care .
<unk> ?
Me ?
Morty , I &apos;m fine with you .
I only did this for him .
You lying bitch .
She kept coming to our house , Morty , and kept asking me .
&quot; Did ... did ... d-did you get a new Morty yet ? &quot;
Because you kept drunk dialing me and crying about it .
I wasn &apos;t crying !
<unk> , I ... I-I-I wasn &apos;t who I said I was .
You weren &apos;t a <unk> boy from the <unk> who ran away from his family and <unk> on his lack of <unk> by becoming a stock <unk> ?
Oh .
I guess I was pretty up front about that , wasn &apos;t I ?
You were up front about everything .
You were my soul mate .
Well ... <unk> ... Not anymore .
I &apos;ll , um ... Y-You can keep the <unk> , and ... and ... and , uh ... the drones .
She can &apos;t keep the drones .
They turn into a little <unk> robot .
They &apos;re awesome .
You can &apos;t keep the drones .
So , how was your date with Brad ?
It wasn &apos;t a date .
We were just having lunch .
You guys are getting back together , aren &apos;t you ?
Morty , I need your help on an adventure .
Eh , &quot; need &quot; is a strong word .
We need door stops , but a brick would work , too .
Okay .

The answer may not surprise you .
It &apos;s ...
Yes , it &apos;s <unk> .
Those stories and more , after this break .
Sam Elliot : 60 <unk> off the central finite curve , there &apos;s a Rick that works more with wood than <unk> <unk> .
His name is Simple Rick but he &apos;s no dummy .
He realized long ago that the greatest thing he &apos;d ever create was his daughter .

They were ...
They were about my height , around 14 years old ... oh , their ... their shirts were yellow !
Yeah , make sure you get &lt; i &gt; that &lt; / i &gt; down .

Okay , <unk> Rick , how would you solve the Citadel &apos;s financial crisis ?

Now , I believe the answer to your question has three parts .
First , <unk> spending must get &lt; i &gt; much &lt; / i &gt; higher ... &lt; i &gt; But it has to be <unk> with defense ... &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Whoa !

All right , cut the high-road routine .
We both saw Tommy &apos;s shitty play .
You pushed him in the Honey Swamp , Beth .
His very happy life is in your hands .
You go save him from it .
&#91; Scoffs &#93; You &apos;re gonna believe a play over your own daughter ?
Yes , I am , Beth , because you &apos;re not my own daughter .
Oh , God , yes .
I &apos;m one of infinite <unk> with infinite fathers in infinite universes .
It &apos;s called a hug , Dad .
It won &apos;t kill you .
Yeah , don &apos;t be so sure .
You know why all Ricks made a Froopyland for all their little girls ?
Same reason I wasn &apos;t <unk> by Tommy &apos;s <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> flashback .
You were a scary fuckin &apos; kid , man .
&#91; <unk> &#93; Oh , my God .
I didn &apos;t make Froopyland to get rid of you , Beth .
I did it to protect the neighborhood .
Not in a &#91; burps &#93; noble sense .
It was just more practical to <unk> you before I had to start , you know , <unk> a replacement for every <unk> little boy or gullible animal that might cross your <unk> .
You would rather believe I &apos;m evil than admit that you were a bad father ?
Oh , dude , no .
No , bad father all the way to the <unk> over here .
I &apos;m a fuckin &apos; <unk> .
And the <unk> <unk> straight down , baby .
Look at some of this shit you were asking me to make you as a kid .
Ray guns .
A whip that <unk> people to like you .
<unk> <unk> , a parent trap , a <unk> gun , a <unk> bear with <unk> correct <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> sneakers , false fingerprints , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> doll , an <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> shaped like a <unk> , a fake police <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> hair clips , poison <unk> , a pink , sentient <unk> .
Hi , Beth , you &apos;ve gotten <unk> .
Shall we resume <unk> ?
Has it occurred to you that I asked you to make those things because I wanted you to spend time with me ?
Has it occurred to you that &lt; i &gt; if &lt; / i &gt; I did try killing Tommy , it might be because I was jealous of his family ?
Wait , what ?
Why ?
<unk> &apos;t his dad , like , some kind of <unk> ?
Seems like it must be <unk> .
Oh , my God .
This is your fault .
I am not a bad person .
I &apos;m gonna go back in there , I &apos;m getting Tommy , and I &apos;m <unk> this !
Whatever you say , Stone Cold Steve Austin .
&#91; Jingling &#93; I don &apos;t know why I just said that .
Doesn &apos;t make a lot of sense , but gotta stand by it .
Whatever you say , Stone Cold Steve Austin .
I &apos;m <unk> it .
&#91; Ax swings &#93; Morty : No , Dad !
You &apos;re not doing it right !
&#91; Ax swings &#93; <unk> off their heads isn &apos;t doing it right ?
They &apos;re &#91; grunts &#93; clearly <unk> !
I-I think you have to stab them through the heart or something .
You think or you know ?
I thought you were the alien expert , <unk> <unk> .
Don &apos;t snap at me !
I &apos;m tired !
- Me , too !
- We &apos;re all tired !
&#91; Ax swings &#93; &#91; Whoosh &#93; &#91; Grunts &#93; That &apos;s the last of them .
Tonight , we celebrate .
With a hunt ?
Yes , for tomorrow , we hunt .
&#91; <unk> <unk> &#93; &#91; Clears throat &#93; I , uh , really have to get out of this soul bond .
- What the fuck , Dad ?
- Oh , my God !
Duh !
- Obviously !
- Yeah , no kidding !
Can you guys help me ?
What ?
How ?
Can I just , uh , tell her it &apos;s because of my kids ?
You know , like , you don &apos;t like the shape of her head , or ... That &apos;s you , Dad !
That &apos;s &lt; i &gt; you ! &lt; / i &gt; You &apos;re a baby and an idiot !
I think that &apos;s been <unk> , Summer .
Now help me !
First , I want you to admit that you &apos;re a closet racist , a <unk> sexist , and you dragged everyone into a horrible situation by only thinking of yourself .
Okay .
I want to hear you say it .
&#91; Sighs deeply &#93; Look , I &apos;m a <unk> racist , and I &apos;m sexist and selfish , and I dragged us all into my sexist , racist bad things because I &apos;m stupid .
Thank you .
Now you &apos;re gonna help me , right ?
She just did .
Yeah , clean up your own mess .
Wait , wait , what ?
Oh , man .
&#91; Trumpet fanfare &#93; Tommy : All right , everybody .
Next <unk> on the <unk> ...
I would like to have sex with some of you , and then eat the babies .
&#91; Froopys murmuring &#93; I thought you &apos;d like that .
I do keep rolling out the hits , don &apos;t I ?
&#91; <unk> &#93; Oh !
It &apos;s the <unk> <unk> Lady !
Are you hungry ?
I was just about to make dinner .
And by &quot; make dinner , &quot; I mean ... Tommy , I &apos;m going to take you to the real world .
Well , this &lt; i &gt; is &lt; / i &gt; the real world .
No , you don &apos;t understand !
Your dad ...
Uh , people think your dad ate you !
So ?
You <unk> !
People should eat people .
Just leave me alone !
Tommy , you don &apos;t understand .
I have to make this right because it &apos;s my fault that you &apos;re in here .
I &apos;m Beth .
&#91; All gasp &#93; - Beth ?
- The destroyer !
The destroyer !
Oh , suck it up , <unk> <unk> .
You fell into some honey .
Well , it <unk> to happen when one is pushed into honey .
I respect your right to believe I pushed you .
Oh , do I get to have that ?
Is my reality like a little side of <unk> ... a little <unk> you &apos;re willing to slide my way ?
Yes , because I &apos;m <unk> on saving your father &apos;s life because I &apos;m not a petty piece of shit .
So , then , it should be pretty easy to say , &quot; Sorry I pushed you . &quot;
Real easy and not necessary , since you coming home will save your dad &apos;s life <unk> nothing is changed by anyone <unk> your <unk> ego .
Sorry , forgive me .
Uh , I &apos;ve been in Froopyland for quite a while .
Have <unk> changed ?
Tommy , I &apos;m sorry you think you deserve an apology .
Oh , my God .
I &apos;m my father .
Uh , will someone just kill this <unk> ?
&#91; Froopys <unk> <unk> &#93; &#91; Grunts &#93; <unk> !
Oh , my God .

Ooh !

You have to leave school .
Wait , what are my values ?
Dad , what &apos;s going on ?

Also , I broke up with Kiara , and she didn &apos;t take it well , and she wants to murder you two .

Because I told her it was your fault .

I feel like I &apos;ve spent my life pretending you &apos;re a great guy and trying to be like you .
And the ugly truth has always been ... That I &apos;m not that great a guy and you &apos;re exactly like me .
Am I evil ?
<unk> .
You &apos;re smart .
When you know nothing matters , the universe is yours .
And I &apos;ve never met a universe that was into it .
The universe is basically an animal .
It <unk> on the ordinary .
It creates infinite idiots just to eat them , not <unk> your friend <unk> .
Tommy .
Yeah , it hardly matters now , sweetie .
You know , smart people get a chance to <unk> on top , take reality for a ride , but it &apos;ll never stop trying to throw you .
And , eventually , it will .
There &apos;s no other way off .
Dad , I &apos;m out of <unk> to not be who I am .
So who am I ?
What do I do ?
My advice ... Take off .
Put a <unk> on your universe .
Let it kick itself out .
I can &apos;t do that .
The kids , Jerry , my job , and , as much as I hate to admit it , <unk> &apos;s &quot; The <unk> . &quot;
I can make a clone of you , a perfect instance of you , with all your memories .
An exact copy in every way .
It &apos;ll love and provide for the kids , do your job , and <unk> <unk> reality TV on the same <unk> ironic level as you .
You could be gone a day , a week , or the rest of your life with zero consequences .
The moment you <unk> to come back , I flip a switch , and the clone &apos;s job is done .
It feels no pain , it <unk> nothing , and has zero chance of going &quot; Blade <unk> . &quot;
If nothing matters , why would you do that for me ?
I don &apos;t know , maybe you matter so little that I like you .
Or maybe it makes you matter .
Maybe I love you .
Maybe something about your mother .
Don &apos;t jump a gift shark in the mouth .
I don &apos;t know if I can do it .
Then stay , and <unk> in a life you can finally know you &apos;ve <unk> .
My secret <unk> is that no matter what you choose , you &apos;re finally gonna chill the fuck out .
Okay .
I know what I want to do .
&#91; Whoosh &#93; Aah !
&#91; Thud &#93; Ow !
You can &apos;t run forever !
She &apos;s really pissed off .
I know .
It &apos;s <unk> hot .
Shut up !
The hunters !
They &apos;re back !
Run !
- We &apos;re not hunters .
- We want to hide with you .
We &apos;re not hiding .
We &apos;re <unk> .
Ooh la la .
&#91; All scream &#93; The children must be destroyed so that we can be together .
You need to break up with her , Dad ... properly !
&#91; Whoosh &#93; God damn it , Dad !
&#91; Grunts &#93; Dump her !
Okay , okay .
Kiara , let &apos;s just run away .
- Dad !
- Come on !
Just rip the <unk> off !
Okay !
Kiara , when I told you my kids were <unk> racists who were <unk> I break up with you , I lied .
If anybody <unk> to be <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s me .
&lt; i &gt; I &apos;m &lt; / i &gt; the one who wants to break up .
I ...
I &apos;m not an evil person .
I &apos;m lazy , I &apos;m <unk> , and ... and I do not know what I &apos;m doing .
Look , I got someone pregnant at 17 .
We &apos;re getting a divorce .
None of this is on purpose .
I was excited to date someone cool because it would make my ex notice me .
I would expect nothing less from humanity ... a selfish , <unk> , dishonest species that ... - Kiara ?
- <unk> !
What are you doing here ?
Just ... hunting .
Do you really expect me to believe it has nothing to do with us ?
You knew Earth was my domain .
I don &apos;t like what you &apos;re <unk> .
Dad , can we go now ?
Hold on a second .
I &apos;m starting to get the feeling that &lt; i &gt; I &lt; / i &gt; was the rebound .
Dad , you just got <unk> an <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;re taking it .
Varrix <unk> spread across 300 galaxies , and you just happened to pick this planet to hunt ?
That &apos;s Gorgon shit ... total Gorgon shit !
&#91; Birds chirping &#93; We &apos;re home !
Hey , guys !
What &apos;s for dinner ?
How was Jerry &apos;s ?
The usual .
Can we have pizza ?
Pizza sounds great .
Hey , Rick , did you know my dad was dating an alien ?
No .
Gross .
For the alien .
Aw , crap , I think Arnaldo &apos;s is closed .
Are you guys sure you want pizza ?
&#91; Whoosh &#93; Arnaldo &apos;s isn &apos;t closed in the dimension where they didn &apos;t invent <unk> <unk> !
What would we do without you ?
I love you , Dad .
Love you , too , sweetie .

So , you &apos;re mining stuff to craft with and crafting stuff to mine with ?
Uh-huh .
Did your dad write this game ?
Mean .
Gentlemen , you &apos;re needed by a friend in Washington !
How <unk> .
If they can teleport , why did we take ...
I just work here , Steve , same as you !
All right .
All right , all right .
Mr. President .
It &apos;s about time , gentlemen .
Rick , do you need to drink in here ?
Yes .
Here &apos;s the adventure .
Some kind of alien ... <unk> has infested the Kennedy Sex Tunnels .
I want it hunted down and taken out .
Kennedy Sex Tunnels ?
<unk> , you &apos;ll forget you saw them , along with , in order of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> Dump , and the Lincoln <unk> <unk> .
He didn &apos;t free them all .
And let me know when you &apos;re done .
Maybe then we could get a selfie ?
Too busy , Morty .
Now tell me about this <unk> .
Is it a peace one or a regular one ?
Ugh .
This sucks .
God , tell me about it .
Oh , man .
If you &apos;re not into it ... What do you mean ?
Why would I be into it ?
It &apos;s lame .
You &apos;re into lame stuff , Morty .
I thought young dumb people considered it an honor to work for <unk> or whatever the shit .
Maybe the first few times , but this just sucks .
He treats us like Ghostbusters .
We should talk to him .
Yeah , that sounds fun .
Let &apos;s set some <unk> with a <unk> control freak that thinks he runs the world and orders drone strikes to cope with his insecurity .
It &apos;s either that or more of this .
Third choice ...
&quot; Minecraft . &quot;
You like it now ?
Got to be honest , Morty .
It &apos;s growing on me .
<unk> the president .
What do I tell him ?
Tell him the truth .
Tell him Rick and Morty just blew off America .
♪ You can use that wood to make a chest .
Oh , good .
Then I can store all this wood I &apos;ll need later for <unk> .
Okay .
You &apos;re not going to have fun if you analyze everything .
This is what they &apos;d rather do ?
It &apos;s all in the <unk> .
&quot; <unk> us like Ghostbusters . &quot;
So , Ghostbusters aren &apos;t cool now ?
I don &apos;t recall <unk> that bill .
&quot; Control freak . &quot;
&quot; <unk> drone strikes to cope with ... &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Should we <unk> them ?
That would prove them right !
And blow him up .
Give me the phone .
Is this game popular with <unk> people ?
Why would you say something like that ?
&apos;Cause I &apos;m starting to love it .
&quot; <unk> to answer is a <unk> offense &quot; ?
Play it cool .
As far as he knows , we &apos;re still in the <unk> .
When should we reveal we can see them ?
We &apos;re holding all the cards right now .
We don &apos;t show any before the time is right .
- Awesome .
- <unk> ?
Hi , guys .
<unk> President calling .
How &apos;s it going ?
Oh , hey .
Just hard at work on this sex tunnel gagoo .
I think it &apos;s kind of our new <unk> , you know ?
It might take a while .
What do you think , Morty ... a month ?
Fingers crossed , a month , yeah .
You lying dicks !
I see your asses playing &quot; Minecraft &quot; !
I got you on satellite !
That &apos;s right .
What do you have to say for yourselves ?
Okay , obviously , this looks bad , Mr. President .
I mean , what doesn &apos;t look bad through an illegal spy satellite ?
Don &apos;t high-road me .
The two of you break 1,000 federal laws a day .
Wow , really ?
That &apos;s pretty cool .
And , yes , yes , yes , yes , you save the world now and then .
America <unk> that favor by not holding the two of you accountable to its laws .
Oh !
Oh !
Oh , God .
We ... We didn &apos;t know you saw it that way .
Well , it &apos;s nobody &apos;s fault .
We never had &quot; the talk , &quot; so to speak .
Yeah .
I mean , the way we see it , when we show up , that &apos;s the favor to you .
Especially , you know , when it turns out you wanted someone to come over just because you found an &quot; <unk> &quot; monster in your <unk> .
As for the reason you &apos;ve never , like , arrested us , we assumed you just knew that it was impossible , like , if you tried .
You know , it wouldn &apos;t go well .
Wouldn &apos;t go well ?
Can you elaborate ?
I think one of your 1,000 laws says , no , I can &apos;t elaborate .
Just trust me .
None of us want to go there .
Which we &apos;ll never have to .
By the way , we &apos;ll keep on saving the Earth .
You know , we &apos;re ... We &apos;re happy to do that .
Yeah , but not because it <unk> America ... Because moving to a new version of Earth is a bitch and a half .
But feel free to call us , you know , as ... as , like , friends .
Yeah , like , if you ever want to take a selfie ...
So , are we cool ?
Yes .
Thank you , gentlemen .
I told you , man !
I &apos;m impressed , Morty .
That went really well .
Everybody , get ahold of yourselves !
Sir , what is our new Rick and Morty policy ?
Our policy is , we never needed them and never will again .
Today , we celebrate our <unk> from Rick and Morty .
Everyone out .
&lt; i &gt; All this <unk> at <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a clothes sale . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Come on down to the clothes section . &lt; / i &gt; I just put it on for fun .
I know I can &apos;t buy it .
Oh , come on .
You look great !
You &apos;re only young once .
Just promise , if the <unk> are too strong , you &apos;ll use <unk> .
Really ? !
Thanks !
When did you get rad ?
I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I <unk> to the divorce and everything &apos;s new .
I &apos;ll say .
I couldn &apos;t stand you for more than an hour at a time before .
No ... No offense .
I like it .
It &apos;s great .
You &apos;re like a different person .
Yeah .
<unk> person .
Oh , not you .
Vamos !
Vamos !
Aaah !
How do you like that , Morty ?
Whoa !
Just like &quot; Minecraft &quot; !
Ooh , a tiny <unk> species just got discovered in the Amazon .
Let &apos;s go make first contact before someone else gets all their shit .
What about this ?
South Park did it 4 years ago , Morty .
They &apos;re fast .
Or we &apos;re slow .
Don &apos;t do it , guys .
The casualties would be in the &quot; <unk> &quot; because you &apos;re <unk> .
It &apos;s a threat and a pun .
Nobody gets me .
<unk> !
<unk> !
Oh .
Hello , Rick .
You &apos;re here , too .
I guess this is a global crisis .
Oh , God .
Mr. President , Morty and I have the situation covered .
I &apos;m sure you did .
Dismissed .
Dismissed ?
Yeah , dismissed .
Not needed here .
You can leave and nobody will care .
Have you never heard that before ?
Do you even know how to take out this kind of threat ?
We &apos;re not taking it out .
We &apos;re going to shrink down and approach them <unk> .
You shrink with pills ?
Are you still here ?
Shouldn &apos;t you be going down to your next version of Earth with your <unk> <unk> &#91; bleep &#93; sidekick ?
Whoa !
We &apos;re allowed to be here .
You aren &apos;t president of the Amazon .
Yeah , I learned about your job in school .
You &apos;re a civil <unk> .
We &apos;re technically your boss .
Oh , please , Morty .
You pay as many taxes as you have pubes .
Oh , I got pubes , Commander-in-Queef .
You want to count them ?
Commander-in-Queef .
That &apos;s it !
Do it !
<unk> the rare element Sanchez-eum ?
We &apos;ve been <unk> for a Rick-level <unk> for some time .
You mean you &apos;ve been ordering other people to prepare for it while you sat on your ass at peace summits .
Peace summits are important !
Oh , yeah !
They work great !
We &apos;re really drowning in peace !
You suck !
You suck !
Task Force Alpha , prepare to shrink .
Is there a Task Force Alpha health plan , by the way ?
Because if those pills are based on <unk> <unk> , you could get a more <unk> cancer just walking through the <unk> clouds .
God damn it !
I &apos;ll do it .
Whoa .
Task Force Alpha is <unk> .
And you two aren &apos;t American anymore !
I can say that .
You &apos;re <unk> !
If you step foot on <unk> soil again , I &apos;ll treat it as an invasion .
Is this supposed to be painful ?
<unk> to watch .
Oh , such lame shrinking .
Oh , his clothes stay the same size ?
<unk> shrinking , party of one .
Eat my shrinking ass !
There he goes .
All right .
Let &apos;s get out of here , Morty .
What the hell ? !
I made Sanchez-eum up , <unk> .
Don &apos;t believe everything you read on <unk> .
Stand down .
He &apos;s not afraid of pirates .
Oh !
Run , Morty !
That part was true !
I-I can &apos;t talk now , sweetie .
Oh , when can you ?
- Good point .
- What &apos;s up ?
Remember a little while ago when you said that , if I wanted , I could , like , leave Earth and wander the infinite cosmos to figure out who I am and that nobody would ever know I &apos;d left because you could replace me with a clone ?
Mm-hmm .
Am I the clone ?
Sorry .
What ?
Am I the clone ?
Did the real me choose to leave , and I only think I chose to stay because that &apos;s what I need to think because I &apos;m the replacement Beth ?
No .
Okay .
And one more thing .
If I were a clone , would you tell me ?
Beth , you know , when ...
When smart people get happy , they stop <unk> themselves .
And you are very smart because you &apos;re very much my daughter .
Oh , God .
You &apos;re right .
I &apos;m sorry .
Thank you , Dad .
All good ?
Totally .
I &apos;m fine now .
And just to be sure , you &apos;re not pretending to be convinced you &apos;re real because you &apos;re actually convinced you &apos;re a clone and you &apos;re now terrified that becoming self-aware would mean I &apos;d have to <unk> you ?
No .
Okay .
Glad I could help .
See you soon .
Aaaaaah !
Where do I go ?
What does th ... What ... What ... What ... What does this mean ?
This means nothing .
Pull forward and park .
Then say that , God damn it !
Sorry .
Bad day .
I am Presidentress of the <unk> <unk> .
We named ourselves before learning we were small .
<unk> Presidentress , I &apos;m President of America , which is basically the world , but you didn &apos;t hear that from me .
I &apos;ve come to ...
I know who you are .
We &apos;ve already agreed to a ceasefire with your <unk> , Rick and Morty .
Rick and Morty were here ?
Of course they were here .
They can shrink instantly and teleport .
They told me to give you this .
They said it will <unk> as your cancer pill wears off and your body <unk> <unk> at the rate of a &apos; 50s movie .
Are there pants ?
They said you &apos;d prefer just a shirt .
Apparently , you have a need to swing your dick around ?
Rick and Morty escaped .
No shit .
Take me to the Pentagon .
We &apos;re at war with Rick and Morty .
You &apos;ll want to make a stop at the White House ?
I have pants at the Pentagon , <unk> .
It &apos;s in my <unk> .
I mean you need to call a press conference .
Israel and <unk> have <unk> a <unk> ceasefire .
What ?
They <unk> something called .
&quot; The Pretty <unk> If You Think About It &quot; <unk> .
Apparently , an <unk> American <unk> took them to a &quot; Star Wars &quot; <unk> , where they <unk> <unk> alien <unk> through a laser <unk> .
I still say it has to be <unk> .
It was Rick and Morty , you &#91; bleep &#93; <unk> !
But you &apos;re getting the credit , sir .
Your approval <unk> just hit 1 .
Why would Rick and Morty want that ?
Because they &apos;re assholes !
I &apos;m flattered , but it takes a whole team to achieve what we did today .
Thank you .
Well ?
They haven &apos;t been back home , sir .
We &apos;ve got every possible location under surveillance .
God damn it !
They &apos;re right here !
They &apos;re here , God damn it !
Code Red !
We need backup !
Everybody relax .
Just waiting for you in the only room you can &apos;t blow up or spy on .
So , we &apos;re not changing timelines for you , but now you have everything you want , so you can forget we exist , and we &apos;ll return the favor .
You couldn &apos;t say that in a text ?
Well , since we won &apos;t be seeing each other again , my ... Guys , we get it .
It &apos;s a Code Red .
Enough .
My grandson has worked hard for you , and I feel like he &apos;s <unk> a selfie .
Honestly , I could take it or leave it at this point .
You &apos;re taking it .
No .
What kind of <unk> <unk> move is that ?
Get out of my office !
Seriously ?
You &apos;re that stubborn ?
He &apos;s the stubborn one .
I &apos;m protecting my country .
Uh , from <unk> ?
From <unk> to hostile powers .
Uh , does China know about that <unk> ?
China doesn &apos;t piss on the White House .
Well , why would they ?
I &apos;m sure it was <unk> .
Get out .
Not without a selfie .
<unk> them .
Son , you have a right to refuse his order , and I guarantee you &apos;re going to die if you touch me , and there &apos;s no afterlife .
Everything just goes black .
Don &apos;t do it .
Whoa , Rick !
Okay .
What was that ?
Death .
What kind ?
<unk> .
There was no sound .
He just died .
Yeah , terrifying .
It &apos;s a terrifying thing to watch happen .
It &apos;s called a deterrent .
You couldn &apos;t just knock him out ?
How is <unk> out a deterrent ?
Everyone wants to be knocked out .
Nobody wants to be dead .
You committed murder in the <unk> <unk> .
Now you can &apos;t leave .
That &apos;s fine .
I said I &apos;m not leaving without a selfie .
Uh , I don &apos;t need a selfie .
And I &apos;m saying you aren &apos;t getting one and you aren &apos;t leaving .
So we agree ?
Yes .
No .
We disagree because you think you &apos;re getting a selfie and leaving .
Am I getting a selfie ?
Never .
Then I &apos;m never leaving .
Exactly .
See ?
Does anyone have a shot ?
Yes , nine people .
I can show you .
But I wouldn &apos;t <unk> ... Open fire !
God , you are dumb !
Get the President out of here !
Bad idea .
Wait .
Why ?
Because if there isn &apos;t someone in here that they &apos;re not supposed to kill , they &apos;re going to <unk> the place trying to kill me .
As long as you live , no matter where you are , if it isn &apos;t in a selfie with him , I &apos;ll be here .
Jesus !
He &apos;s not a &#91; bleep &#93; god !
You don &apos;t know what I am !
And you don &apos;t know what I can do !
Jesus !
It &apos;s ...
It &apos;s cool , Rick !
I &apos;m <unk> Who in this &#91; bleep &#93; I could be a clone .
I could be a hologram .
We could be clones controlled by robots controlled with special <unk> that the real Rick and Morty are wearing while they &apos;re &#91; bleep &#93; your mother !
I &apos;m going to kill you !
Then come to <unk> <unk> Street !
Is that her <unk> ?
You don &apos;t know because you &apos;re a bad son !
Ow !
Take him down !
<unk> <unk> !
Aaaaah !
&lt; i &gt; Number three , The <unk> . &lt; / i &gt; Ow !
Damn it .
&lt; i &gt; Number four ... &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; The <unk> <unk> . &lt; / i &gt; Beth ?
My dad might have cloned me , and I might be the clone .
And he says I &apos;m not , but that &apos;s what he &apos;d say to a clone .
<unk> .
&lt; i &gt; Number six , The <unk> <unk> . &lt; / i &gt; You look like you to me .
What are you , an idiot ?
I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;m sorry .
That was so rude .
I came to you for help , and now I &apos;m insulting your intelligence .
And look where intelligence gets you .
Well , don &apos;t knock intelligence , because right now I &apos;d love to understand how I can help you .
I can &apos;t be in charge of that , Jerry .
My mind , my ideas are all part of the <unk> .
The only <unk> is you .
You know me inside and out .
Do what you have to do .
Okay .
Sit down .
Now cross your legs .
That leg on top .
Good .
Oh , what is this ?
<unk> year , I took you on a date to the <unk> <unk> <unk> performing the music of Alan <unk> in the Park .
At this point in the song from &quot; <unk> , &quot; when Tommy <unk> Jones and the <unk> <unk> are using cars to guide the lava into a <unk> , I realized my <unk> were so sweaty , I would never get to hold your hand .
But I was <unk> to touch you , so I wiped my <unk> on the <unk> next to me .
But a Snickers <unk> kind of got stuck on it , so I started kind of <unk> it , <unk> it without moving too much .
But you started looking over , and I thought , &quot; Well , this is it .
She &apos;s going to see that I &apos;m a loser , &quot; and I &apos;ll never get to touch her .
&quot; But I still have time to touch her . &quot;
But my hand had Snickers on it , and the <unk> section was swelling because it was the scene with the guy melting in the lava .
And I just thought , &quot; &#91; Bleep &#93; it .
<unk> don &apos;t sweat . &quot;
Wow .
Yeah .
I &apos;ll never forget that feeling .
You &apos;re the real thing .
Then that <unk> it , because my memory is of hating that night .
But now , <unk> it , all I can feel is how lucky I am to be loved by such a simple , honest , simple man .
Simple twice .
This isn &apos;t the woman you married , Jerry , because this woman loves you .
Uh ... well , <unk> la <unk> .
Okay .
That was lame .
Listen , I ...
Words .
Don <unk> .
You have the right to get the &#91; bleep &#93; out of my office !
You have the right to kiss my dick !
Give me the thing .
Ugh !
Oh !
Ugh !
Oh !
Ugh !
Ugh !
Ohh !
Submit !
Submit for the selfie !
I yield !
I yield !
Take the selfie !
Okay .
Morty , get in there and say , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Morty ?
Morty , come on !
God damn it !
Rick , don &apos;t get mad , but I-I stole your portal gun .
What the &#91; bleep &#93; Morty ? !
I told you I didn &apos;t want the damn selfie <unk> times !
Look , whatever the hell is going on between you and the president , it &apos;s got nothing to do with me .
So where did you go ?
I can &apos;t tell you .
Rick , did you tell my mom she might be a clone ?
No !
I told her she wasn &apos;t !
Well , isn &apos;t that what you &apos;d tell a clone ?
Oh , for Christ &apos;s sake .
Rick , my mom and dad are getting back together .
What ?
No !
She &apos;s not a clone !
Well , she says it doesn &apos;t matter if she is or isn &apos;t because now she loves my dad , and she wanted me and Summer to come home , and we &apos;re hiding from you so you don &apos;t kill her if she &apos;s a clone in a place I picked that you will never find .
So don &apos;t look for us .
Come on , bitch !
Oh , you come on , bitch .
I &apos;m out .
I &apos;m done .
I &apos;ve got to ...
I &apos;ve got to go .
So I win .
Then I &apos;m in charge , and you can &apos;t leave .
You &apos;re a terrorist .
You &apos;re an enemy of the state , and you kicked me in the balls 10 minutes ago !
The office of the President can &apos;t <unk> with a living god that won &apos;t <unk> to it ...
I mean , <unk> <unk> .
But he &apos;s locked up in Area 51 already , so that doesn &apos;t really count .
Mr. President , I &apos;ll make you a deal .
If you let me use your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , I can go take care of something , and you &apos;ll never see me again .
Yes .
Deal .
<unk> , stand down .
Yeah , yeah .
I don &apos;t want to hear it .
You know I could see them this whole time , right ?
Don &apos;t push it , Sanchez .
He found us !
I told you we shouldn &apos;t have gone to the same cabin as last time !
Oh , we &apos;re not going anywhere .
This ends now .
Dad , if you &apos;re my dad .
Of course , you &apos;re not my dad .
You &apos;re here with a gun because I am a clone .
I guess I have all your daughter &apos;s memories .
So I guess I was her , which makes me related to her .
But I don &apos;t relate to her .
She left her family and me , which means I relate to them .
So if you kill me , fine .
You &apos;re not killing her .
But you &apos;re killing a real family .
And instead of doing that , will you just go away ?
Aren &apos;t there , like , infinite time lines ?
Can &apos;t you just move to one where I don &apos;t know I &apos;m a clone and where a different but identical version of your <unk> <unk> crazy bitch of a daughter can keep making you proud by being somewhere else ?
Beth , you crazy bitch .
You &apos;re my daughter .
I brought this here to kill Jerry .
Oh , my God !
Jesus Christ !
Yeah .
Yeah , yeah .
You win , Jerry .
You win !
No amount of genius can stop your dumb mediocre <unk> <unk> from digging into everything and everyone around you and <unk> them of any ability to <unk> you off .
Well , it couldn &apos;t have been easy for you to say that .
I appreciate it .
Morty , where &apos;s my portal gun ?
Let &apos;s get out of here .
I &apos;m staying here , Rick .
Are you ... Ugh !
Nobody gets it .
Nothing you think matters matters .
This isn &apos;t special .
This ...
This is happening infinite times across infinite realities .
Including this ?
Yes !
Which is not to say that , <unk> , it wasn &apos;t funny .
Are you going to stay ?
There &apos;s infinite time lines , Morty .
Why would I stay in the one where I trashed the White House , became an enemy of America and the <unk> character in my idiot family ?
Because of the fart ?
There &apos;s still some <unk> over there .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;ve ever understood what &quot; <unk> of the <unk> &quot; means !
Hi , Mr. President .
I &apos;m Rick Sanchez , but not the one that did this .
We Ricks travel the infinite and switch places with each other like <unk> <unk> , I think .
I &apos;m fly-fishing Rick .
You can <unk> me from the Rick that you had a <unk> with by my fly-fishing <unk> and <unk> hat .
I hope I can be of service if , uh , you ever find the planet to be in danger .
Friends ?
Sounds good to me .
Kids , dinner !
I got Panda <unk> !
Did you get sugar chicken ?
That &apos;s kind of the only thing they have .
I love Panda E !
Thanks , Mom !
I &apos;m hoping to get a piece of your sugar chicken later .
Stop it .
Here &apos;s your stupid hat , dipshit .
Dad , you can &apos;t talk to Jerry that way anymore .
We &apos;re a real family now .
In many ways , things will be like season 1 but more <unk> .
Now Jerry and I are <unk> married parents , and the idea that I was motivated by a fear of you leaving can be <unk> .
<unk> ?
You &apos;ve never used that word .
Maybe you are a clone .
It &apos;s not like Rick would tell us .
♪ Ooh-wee !
What a season !
Sorry I never showed up , but I got married .
I had a baby .
I went back to school and got my <unk> . What did you do while you were waiting ?
Hopefully you didn &apos;t just &#91; bleep &#93; around and waste your life .
Ooh-wee !
See you for Season 4 in , like , a really long time !
