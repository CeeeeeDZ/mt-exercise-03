Morty , you got to ... come on .
- You got to come with me .
- Rick , what &apos;s going on ?
I got a surprise for you , Morty .
It &apos;s the middle of the night .
What are you talking about ?
I got a surprise for you .
Ow !
Ow !
You &apos;re tugging me too hard .
I got a surprise for you , Morty .
What do you think of this flying vehicle , Morty ?
I built it out of stuff I found in the garage .
Yeah , Rick , it &apos;s great .
- Is this the surprise ?
- Morty , I had to ...
I had to ...
I had to ...
I had to make a bomb , Morty .
- I had to create a bomb .
- What ? !
A bomb ? !
We &apos;re gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start , Morty .
- Create a whole fresh start .
- T-t-that &apos;s absolutely crazy !
Come on , Morty .
Just take it easy , Morty .
It &apos;s gonna be good .
Right now , we &apos;re gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica .
Jessica ?
From my math class ?
When I drop the bomb ... you know , I want you to have somebody , you know I want you to have the thing I &apos;m gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve , and you &apos;re gonna be Adam .
And Jessica &apos;s gonna be Eve , and so that &apos;s the surprise , Morty .
No , you can &apos;t !
Jessica doesn &apos;t even know I exist .
But but forget about that , because you can &apos;t blow up humanity .
I-I get what you &apos;re trying to say , Morty .
Listen , I &apos;m not you don &apos;t you don &apos;t got to worry about me ... trying to fool around with with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything .
I &apos;m I &apos;m not that kind of guy , Morty .
What are you talking about , Rick ?
You you don &apos;t have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything .
She she she she ... she &apos;s all for you , Morty .
I don &apos;t care about Jessica !
You know what , Morty ?
You &apos;re right .
Let &apos;s forget the girl all together .
She she &apos;s probably nothing but trouble , anyways .
&lt; i &gt; Arming neutrino bomb . &lt; / i &gt; That &apos;s it that &apos;s it , Rick .
I &apos;m taking the wheel .
Get off of me , Morty !
I &apos;m taking charge of this situation , buddy .
What &apos;s gotten into you ?
I &apos;m I &apos;m I &apos;m I &apos;m not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb ... What are you , crazy ?
... person and just let you blow up the whole world .
All right , all right .
I &apos;ll I &apos;ll land .
I &apos;ll land .
I &apos;ll land .
I &apos;ll land the thing .
Big tough guy all of a sudden .
We &apos;ll park it right here , Morty .
Right here on the side of the road here .
Oh , thank God .
You know what ?
That was all a test , Morty .
Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive .
It was ?
Sure .
Why not ?
I don &apos;t know .
You you know what , mo- &lt; i &gt; Neutrino bomb armed . &lt; / i &gt; Um ... Corrections by XhmikosR www.MY-SUBS.com I see there &apos;s a new episode of that singing show tonight .
Who do you guys think is gonna be the best singer ?
Oh , my God .
His head is in his food .
- I &apos;m going to puke .
- Morty , are you getting sick ?
I told you not to practice-kiss the living-room pillow .
The dog sleeps on it .
I wasn &apos;t kissing a pillow , mom .
I just I didn &apos;t get a lot of sleep last night .
Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something .
Or maybe you were out all night again with grandpa Rick .
- What ? !
- Dad ?
What , so everyone &apos;s supposed to sleep every single night now ?
You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time ?
Damn it !
- Jerry !
- Beth !
Oh , my God .
My parents are so loud .
I want to die .
Mm , there is no God , summer .
You got to rip that band-aid off now .
You &apos;ll thank me later .
Okay , with all due respect , Rick ... What am I talking about ?
What respect is due ?
How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole ?
Listen , Jerry , I don &apos;t want to overstep my bounds or anything .
It &apos;s your house .
It &apos;s your world .
You &apos;re a real Julius Caesar .
But I &apos;ll tell you some tell you how how I feel about school , Jerry .
It &apos;s a waste of time a bunch of people running around , bumping into each other .
G-guy up front says , &quot; two plus two . &quot;
The people in the back say , &quot; four . &quot;
Then the bell rings , and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something .
I mean , it &apos;s it &apos;s not a place for smart people , Jerry .
And I know that &apos;s not a popular opinion , but it &apos;s my two cents on the issue .
This was a good breakfast , Beth .
You really made the crap out of those eggs .
I wish your mother was here to eat them .
Oh , dad .
What ?
For real ?
All right , now , everybody get settled .
Get away from the windows !
Now , look , we &apos;re gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today .
You might have heard of it .
It &apos;s called math .
And without it , none of us would even exist , so let &apos;s jump right in .
- Two plus two .
- Jessica .
Five plus five .
Tenssica .
Okay , good .
It &apos;s time for the quiz .
Yeah , you know what ? !
Aw , too bad !
Tough !
First row , take one .
Pass it back for me .
&lt; i &gt; The stakes are high in this room . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; There &apos;s crucial things happening here every day . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; People getting smarter .
Some of y &apos;all getting dumber . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Some of y &apos;all ain &apos;t gonna see 3 : 00 . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Hi , Morty . &lt; / i &gt; Whoa !
Hi , Jessica .
Can I show these to you ?
Wow .
Th-they &apos;re both great .
Thank you .
You know what I named these ?
My little morties .
Uh , that &apos;s flattering ... and a little weird .
Do you know what I want you to do with them ?
Rename them ?
Squeeze them .
Manhandle them .
Give them the business .
See if you can shuffle them .
I mean , really get in there and knock them around .
- No wrong answers .
- Wow .
Well , okay , Jessica .
L-let &apos;s give this a shot .
Mm .
Oh , Morty .
What are you doing to me ?
Uh , I-I &apos;m just doing my best .
Morty !
What are you doing to me ? !
Jessica .
Morty !
Jessica .
Five more minutes of this , and I &apos;m gonna get mad .
Je-Jessica .
Jessica .
Not my fault this is happening .
Well , well , well .
- Uh , morning , Frank .
- &quot; Morning &quot; ?
What was what is that supposed to mean ?
You making fun of me ?
Are you trying to say my family &apos;s poor ?
Oh , geez , Frank .
I don &apos;t know if a knife is necessary .
I mean , you know , y-you kind of had things handled without it .
You telling me how to bully now ?
Big mistake , Morty .
And now I &apos;m gonna cut you , &apos; cause my family &apos;s rich .
There you are , Morty .
Listen to me .
I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension .
I need an extra pair of hands .
Oh , geez , Rick .
What &apos;d you do to Frank ?
It &apos;s pretty obvious , Morty .
I froze him .
Now listen I need your help , Morty .
I mean , we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business .
- It &apos;s important .
Come on , Morty .
- I don &apos;t know , Rick .
I can &apos;t leave school again .
Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there , Morty ?
What do you think I can just do it all by myself ?
Come on !
Aw , geez .
Okay .
I guess I can skip history .
What about Frank ?
I mean , shouldn &apos;t you unfreeze him ?
I &apos;ll do it later , Morty .
He &apos;ll be fine .
Let &apos;s go .
&lt; i &gt; Oh , my God .
I &apos;m about to walk past Frank Palicky . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; This is the story we &apos;ll be telling our children . &lt; / i &gt; Hi , Frank .
Aah !
- Scalpel .
- Scalpel .
Knock , knock .
Jerry ?
My manager gave me an hour for lunch , and I thought , &quot; hey , why not swing by where your wife works ? &quot;
We &apos;re losing him .
Okay , he &apos;s back .
Jerry , please tell me you &apos;re here for an incredibly urgent reason .
Well , it &apos;s lunch .
I mean , it &apos;s one of three meals that have existed for millennia .
Losing him .
Stabilized .
Okay , I only ask , Jerry , because , as you know , my job involves performing heart surgery .
- Well , yeah , on horses .
- Excuse me ?
Okay .
Let &apos;s not rehash that fight .
I sense that you &apos;re busy and will now be on my way .
Whoa !
What is this on the floor ?
Some kind of literature for a really nice-looking nursing home .
Hey , honey , crazy idea bad pitch let &apos;s put your dad here .
Let &apos;s put your dad in a nursing home .
We &apos;re losing him .
Hey , Tom .
We know when we &apos;re losing him .
We can hear the beeps !
There she is .
All right .
Come on , Morty .
Let &apos;s go .
Oh , geez .
Okay .
Oh , man , Rick .
What is this place ?
It &apos;s dimension 35c , and it &apos;s got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree , Morty , called a mega tree , and there &apos;s fruit in those trees , and there &apos;s seeds in those fruits .
I &apos;m talking about mega seeds .
They &apos;re they &apos;re incredibly powerful , and I need them to help me with my research , Morty .
Oh , man , Rick .
I &apos;m looking around this place , and I &apos;m starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing .
All right .
All right .
Calm down .
Listen to me , Morty .
I know that new situations can be intimidating .
You &apos;re looking around , and it &apos;s all scary and different , but , you know , m-meeting them head on , charging right into them like a bull that &apos;s how we grow as people .
I &apos;m no stranger to scary situations .
I deal with them all the time .
Now , if you just stick with me , Morty , we &apos;re gonna be holy crap , Morty , run !
I never seen that thing before in my life .
I don &apos;t even know what the hell it is !
We got to get out of here , Morty !
It &apos;s gonna kill us !
We &apos;re gonna die !
We &apos;re gonna die , Morty !
Oh , Morty , take a deep breath .
Breathe that breathe that fresh air in , Morty .
Y-you smell that ?
That &apos;s the smell of adventure , Morty .
That &apos;s that &apos;s the smell of of of of a whole different evolutionary timeline .
All right , Rick , look how much longer is this gonna be ?
Shouldn &apos;t I be back at school by now ?
Are you joking me ?
I mean , look at all the crazy crap surrounding us .
Look at that thing right there .
What the hell is that thing ?
You think you &apos;re gonna see that kind of thing at school ?
Look at it just lumbering around .
It defies all logic that thing .
Yeah , Rick , I get it .
We &apos;re surrounded by monsters .
That &apos;s kind of the reason why I want to leave .
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta .
Morty , you see this ?
You see what we just stumbled upon , Morty ?
Any idea what that is down there ?
The mega trees ?
That &apos;s right , Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about , Morty .
That &apos;s where my seeds are .
If we would have done what you wanted , I would have never have found them , because you &apos;re so in love with school .
All right , all right .
So , what &apos;s so special about these seeds , anyways ?
You ask a lot of questions , Morty .
Not very charismatic .
It makes you kind of an Under underfoot figure .
Just take these shoes , Morty .
They &apos;re special grappling shoes .
When you &apos;re wearing these things , these babies , you can basically just walk on any surface you want , Morty up , down , below , turn around to the left .
These things really bring it all together .
Aah !
You have to turn them on , Morty !
The shoes have to be turned on !
I am not putting my father in a home !
He just came back into my life , and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month &apos;s Victoria &apos;s secret ?
I told you I was ordering you something for Valentine &apos;s day .
More importantly , your father is a horrible influence on our son .
Everything cool in here , Beth ?
- It &apos;s fine , Davin .
- Okay , cool .
You know , we did something great today .
There &apos;s nothing more noble and free than the heart of a horse .
Since we &apos;re fighting , if you ever have an affair with that guy , I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies .
Look , I appreciate the stress you &apos;re under , but ... Morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in , and the only influence I can see Rick having ... is that , for the first time in his life , Morty has a friend .
Well , maybe you &apos;re right .
Uh , yeah , maybe I am .
I &apos;m my father &apos;s daughter .
I &apos;m smart .
Why do you think I &apos;m a heart surgeon ?
Horse heart surgeon .
Hello ?
Mrs. Smith ?
This is principal Vagina , no relation .
I wonder if you and Morty &apos;s father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon ?
Morty , oh , you really d-did a number on your legs right now .
You know , you got to turn the shoes on , Morty , for them to work .
Yeah , look I turned mine on .
I had no problem getting down here .
It was a leisurely breeze .
I &apos;m in a lot of pain , Rick .
Yeah , I can see that .
But do you think you &apos;ll still be able to help me collect my seeds , Morty ?
Are you kidding me ? !
That &apos;s it , Rick !
That &apos;s the last straw !
I can &apos;t believe this !
I &apos;m sitting here with both of my legs broken , and you &apos;re still asking me about getting those seeds ? !
Ooh !
Ow !
Oh !
Y-y-you &apos;re a monster .
Y-you &apos;re like Hitler , but but even Hitler cared about Germany or something .
Okay , hold on just a second , Morty .
Ooh .
Ohh .
Ooh .
Wow , Rick .
That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly .
I mean , I &apos;ve never felt so good in my life .
Thank you .
Don &apos;t worry about it , Morty .
Just come help me get these seeds , all right , buddy ?
Sure thing , Rick .
Not that you asked , Morty , but what just happened there is ...
I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine ... that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore .
The stuff was all over the place , Morty .
Wow , that &apos;s pretty crazy , Rick .
There &apos;s just one problem , Morty one little hang-up .
The dimension I visited was so advanced , they had also halted the aging process , and everyone there was young , Morty , and they had been forever .
I was the only old person there , Morty .
It was like I was some sort of , you know , celebrity , walking around .
I-I was fascinating to them .
There were a lot of attractive women there , Morty , and they they they they all wanted time with me .
I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies , but I spent so much time there , my interdimensional portal device it &apos;s got no charge left , Morty .
- It &apos;s got no charge left .
- What ? !
It &apos;s as good as garbage , Morty .
It &apos;s not gonna work anymore , Morty .
Oh , geez , Rick , that &apos;s not good .
W-what are we gonna do ?
I-I have to be back at school right now .
How are we gonna get back home ?
There &apos;s ways to get back home , Morty .
It &apos;s just it &apos;s just gonna be a little bit of a hassle .
We &apos;re gonna have to go through interdimensional customs , so you &apos;re gonna have to do me a real solid .
Uh-oh .
When we get to customs , I &apos;m gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom , and I &apos;m gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole , Morty .
In my butt ?
Put them way up inside there , as far as they can fit .
Oh , geez , Rick .
I really don &apos;t want to have to do that .
Well , somebody &apos;s got to do it , Morty .
Th-these seeds aren &apos;t gonna get through customs unless they &apos;re in someone &apos;s rectum , Morty .
And they &apos;ll fall right out of mine .
I &apos;ve done this too many times , Morty .
I mean , you &apos;re young .
You &apos;ve got your whole life ahead of you , and your anal cavity is still taut , yet malleable .
You got to do it for grandpa , Morty .
Y-you &apos;ve got to put these seeds inside your butt .
- In my butt ?
- Come on , Morty .
Please , Morty .
You have to do it , Morty .
Oh , man .
The fact is , your son , Morty , has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months .
What ?
Why didn &apos;t you notify us ?
I done been notifying you .
Have you not been getting the messages I &apos;ve been leaving with Morty &apos;s grandfather ?
Boom !
Told you !
In your face !
He is ruining our child !
Wait , what am I celebrating ?
Yeah , see , I thought something was fishy there , because it &apos;s usually Morty &apos;s grandpa that &apos;s taking him out of school .
Summer ?
What kind of God lets this happen ?
We had a little incident .
A student was frozen to death .
And there &apos;s no evidence that a Latino student did it !
Everyone wants to take this to a racial place .
I won &apos;t let them .
&lt; i &gt; The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only . &lt; / i &gt; So , I told him , &quot; give me the blimfarx , &quot; you know ?
This this guy he doesn &apos;t understand interstellar currency .
It &apos;s , like , I &apos;m trying to eat a flimflam like , that &apos;s what we eat on girvonesk .
&lt; i &gt; The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only . &lt; / i &gt; I don &apos;t like it here , Morty .
I can &apos;t abide bureaucracy .
I don &apos;t like being told where to go and what to do .
I consider it a violation .
Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt ?
Yeah , Rick .
Let &apos;s just get this over with , okay ?
I mean , these things are pointy .
They hurt .
That means they &apos;re good ones .
You &apos;re a good kid , Morty .
Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work .
You &apos;ve been a huge help to me .
I &apos;m gonna be able to do all kind of things with them .
It &apos;s gonna be great , Morty .
All kinds of science .
Okay , next through .
Except you .
You go over there .
Why does he have to go over there ?
Random check .
He &apos;s got to go through the new machine .
What new machine ?
It &apos;s a new machine .
It detects stuff all the way up your butt .
Run , Morty !
Run !
Aah !
Red alert !
Ohhhhh !
Hey !
Ohhhhhh .
Aah !
Don &apos;t think about it !
Ooh !
Oh , nice , Morty !
The student becomes the teacher .
Whoooooo !
Aah !
Aw , hell , no , dawg .
You know me I &apos;m just trying to- Aah !
I need to type in the coordinates to our home world , Morty .
- Cover me .
- Oh , man .
I mean , you know , I-I don &apos;t want to shoot nobody .
They &apos;re just robots , Morty !
It &apos;s okay to shoot them !
They &apos;re robots !
Aah !
My leg is shot off !
Glenn &apos;s bleeding to death !
Someone call his wife and children !
They &apos;re not robots , Rick !
It &apos;s a figure of speech , Morty .
They &apos;re bureaucrats .
I don &apos;t respect them .
Just keep shooting , Morty .
You have no idea what prison is like here !
Holy crap !
This is insane !
Come on , Morty !
We got to get the hell out of here !
Wow .
Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal ?
Uh , yeah .
Well , you know , my my Ferrari &apos;s in the shop .
Just kidding .
- You &apos;re Morty , right ?
- Yeah .
You can get his number later .
Come on , Morty .
We got to get out of here .
You got to get those seeds out of your ass .
Oh , look , honey .
It &apos;s our son with Albert Ein-douche .
What ?
I &apos;m an angry father , not an improvisor .
Oh , hi , Jerry .
Oh , my goodness , Morty !
What are you doing out of class ?
We talked about this .
Your your parents and I are very disappointed in in this behavior .
No ?
No takers ?
You guys should really not be touching that stuff .
- It &apos;s beyond your reasoning .
- You &apos;re beyond our reasoning !
Takes one to know one .
Dad , how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school ?
I mean , it &apos;s not like he &apos;s a hot girl .
He can &apos;t just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else &apos;s .
What what are you guys doing with my stuff ?
We &apos;re moving you ... to a nursing home .
A nursing home ?
What are what are you , nuts ?
I &apos;m a genius .
I build robots for fun .
Well , now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS ... and mentally scar the boy scouts every Christmas .
- What does that mean ?
- It &apos;s personal .
Dad , mom , come on .
Rick just needed my help is all .
Morty , stay out of this .
You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own .
What are you trying to say about Morty ?
That he &apos;s stupid or something ?
Oh , don &apos;t high-road us , dad .
You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes .
I-I-I don &apos;t know what you mean by that .
Can can can you be a little bit more specific ?
Oh , for crying out he &apos;s got some kind of disability or something .
Is that what you want us to say ?
I do ?
Well , duh doy , son .
Look , I love you , Morty , but ... we both know you &apos;re not as fast as the other kids , and if you want to compete in this world , you got to work twice as hard .
Aw , geez , dad .
Y-you know , that &apos;s a lot to drop on a kid all at once .
Morty , t-tell your parents the square root of pi .
Oh , come on , Rick .
You know I can &apos;t .
The square root of pi , Morty .
Go !
1.77245385 .
Whoa !
What the hell ?
Holy crap .
He &apos;s right .
Morty , tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics .
&quot; The increment in the internal energy of a system is ... equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system . &quot;
Wow !
I &apos;m so smart !
But I told the both of you school is stupid .
It &apos;s not how you learn things .
Morty &apos;s a gifted child .
He has a special mind .
That &apos;s why he &apos;s my little helper .
He &apos;s like me .
He &apos;s gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life .
He &apos;s too smart for school .
He needs to keep hanging out and helping me .
Jerry , I don &apos;t want whatever &apos;s happening here to stop .
No , I-I understand .
Uh , maybe we overreacted .
But he has to keep going to school .
Okay , Jerry .
You drive a hard bargain , but what am I supposed to do ?
Say no ?
You you really wear the pants around here .
I just want you to know , between us , from now on , it &apos;s gonna be 100 % honesty and open , clear communication .
Frank Palicky was frozen to death today !
No idea what you &apos;re talking about .
Okay .
Well , uh , Morty , it &apos;s your bedtime in an hour .
Don &apos;t stay up all night again .
This is good , though .
This can work .
I think we can be a family .
And now , Beth , if you &apos;ll have me , I would love to have you .
You know what ?
Okay .
Holy cow , Rick .
I didn &apos;t know hanging out with you was making me smarter .
Full disclosure , Morty it &apos;s not .
Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity .
Aw , man .
Yeah , and once those seeds wear off , you &apos;re gonna lose most of your motor skills , and you &apos;re also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours , Morty .
Starting right about now .
Ohh , man .
Oh , geez !
Ohh .
I &apos;m sorry , Morty .
It &apos;s a bummer .
In reality , you &apos;re as dumb as they come .
And I needed those seeds real bad , and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back , so now we &apos;re gonna have to go get more .
And then we &apos;re gonna go on even more adventures after that , Morty .
And you &apos;re gonna keep your mouth shut about it , Morty , because the world is full of idiots that don &apos;t understand what &apos;s important , and they &apos;ll tear us apart , Morty .
But if you stick with me , I &apos;m gonna accomplish great things , Morty , and you &apos;re gonna be part of them , and together , we &apos;re gonna run around , Morty .
We &apos;re gonna do all kinds of wonderful things , Morty .
Just you and me , Morty .
The outside world is our enemy , Morty .
We &apos;re the only friends we &apos;ve got , Morty .
It &apos;s just Rick and Morty .
Rick and Morty and their adventures , Morty .
Rick and Morty forever and forever .
100 years , Rick and Morty &apos;s things .
Me and Rick and Morty running around , and Rick and Morty time .
All day long , forever .
All a hundred days .
Rick and Morty forever 100 times .

&lt; i &gt; Coin collecting is considered the perfect hobby . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; ... beautiful putt right &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; there good birdie . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; That &apos;s only the ... eighth birdie of the day . &lt; / i &gt; What ?
Why are you looking at me ?
You want to go outside ?
Outside ?
Outside ?
Are you kidding me ? !
- Come on !
- Oh , my God .
- What &apos;s wrong ?
- Your idiot dog !
Oh , he he didn &apos;t mean it , dad .
Did you , snuffles ?
You &apos;re a good boy .
Don &apos;t praise him now , Morty !
He just peed on the carpet !
Bad dog !
Bad !
Morty , come on .
I need your help tonight .
Hey , wait , hold on a second , Rick .
You wouldn &apos;t by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter , would you ?
I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior , Jerry .
If I were you , I wouldn &apos;t pull that thread .
Come on , Morty .
Listen , Rick , if you &apos;re gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science , the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family .
You make that dog smart or ... Morty &apos;s grounded !
- Ha-ha !
- Aw , man !
Boy , you really got me up against a wall this time , Jerry .
All right , ruffles ... What &apos;s his name ?
Snuffles .
Snuffles , shake .
Roll over .
Go to the bathroom .
- Holy crap !
- No way .
Yeah , you &apos;re at the top of your game now , Jerry .
Have fun .
Come on , Morty .
- That was fantastic , Rick !
- Yeah , Morty , if you like that , boy , you &apos;re you &apos;re really going to flip your lid over this one .
W-w-w-what is it ?
It &apos;s a device , Morty , that when you put it in your ear , you can enter people &apos;s dreams , Morty .
It &apos;s just like that movie that you keep crowing about .
- You talking about &quot; Inception &quot; ?
- That &apos;s right , Morty .
This is gonna be a lot like that , except , you know , it &apos;s gonna maybe make sense .
&quot; Inception &quot; made sense .
You don &apos;t have to try to impress me , Morty .
Listen , tonight we &apos;re gonna go into the home of your math teacher , Mr. Goldenfold , and we &apos;re gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A &apos;s in math , Morty .
That way you can , you know , y-you &apos;re gonna help me with my science , Morty , all the time .
Geez , Rick , in the time it took you to make this thing , couldn &apos;t you have just , you know , helped me with my homework ?
Are you listening to me , Morty ?
Homework is stupid .
The whole point is to get less of it .
Come on , let &apos;s just get over there and deal with this thing .
W-we &apos;re gonna incept your teacher .
You &apos;re frustrating me .
&lt; i &gt; You don &apos;t know me ! &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Nice , Mrs. Pancakes real nice . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Next week on &quot; The days and nights of Mrs. Pancakes &quot; ... &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; You don &apos;t know me ! &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Then let me get to know yo , damn it ! &lt; / i &gt; Uh-oh !
Spoilers !
I &apos;m a full season behind .
Wow , Rick , I can &apos;t believe we &apos;re sitting around , standing around in Mr. Goldenfold &apos;s house .
It &apos;s really weird .
It &apos;s about to get a whole lot weirder , Morty .
Wheat thins .
Wheat thins .
I &apos;ll take two .
Oh , I think you &apos;ve had enough , sir .
You don &apos;t know me .
All right , Morty , time to make our move .
Make it bounce .
No , you didn &apos;t .
Oh , jiggle it now .
You better stop with that .
Allahu akbar !
We &apos;re gonna take control of this plane !
We &apos;re gonna 9 / 11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math !
Hey !
I said nobody move , buddy !
The name &apos;s not buddy .
It &apos;s Goldenfold .
Nice to wheat you !
Take cover , Morty !
Ooh !
Goldenfold &apos;s got more control here than I anticipated .
I mean , the guy teaches high-school math .
I didn &apos;t take him for an active dreamer .
We got to take him out so he wakes up , Morty .
But we can &apos;t get killed .
If you get killed in someone else &apos;s dream , you die for real , Morty .
What ? !
Are you kidding me ? !
Ohhhhhh !
Don &apos;t be a baby !
You avoid getting shot in real life all the time , Morty .
Just do the same thing here , and we &apos;ll be fine !
Now bring me my slippers .
Now , be my footstool , snuffles .
This is what I &apos;m talking about .
- This is a dog .
- Oh , yeah .
This should play out just fine .
You said the same thing , equally sarcastically , at our wedding and guess what .
Oh , my God .
He &apos;s trying to tell us something .
That is so awesome .
Aw , he &apos;s saying &quot; I love lasagna &quot; .
He &apos;s saying &quot; I love Obama &quot; .
So cute !
I &apos;m posting this online , like , right now .
I should call Bob Saget .
Is that still a thing ?
Hmm ?
Goldenfold , we &apos;re coming out !
We just want to talk !
Why would I negotiate with you ?
Because we &apos;re both rational adults that don &apos;t want anything bad to happen .
And because I have a human shield .
Mrs. Pancakes !
Oh , no , Morty .
His subconscious is panicking .
Run !
Relax , Morty .
Look !
Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute .
Come on !
Hey , you don &apos;t know me !
Oh , no , Rick , look !
Goldenfold landed the plane , and he &apos;s created a mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava !
- Pretty concise , Morty .
Looks like we &apos;ve merely prolonged the inevitable .
That &apos;s it , Morty !
Prolonging the inevitable !
Listen , if we go into Mrs. Pancakes &apos; dream , everything will go 100 times slower , Morty .
That &apos;ll buy us some time to figure this out !
You don &apos;t know m- All right , let &apos;s go .
Oh , man , Rick , this is pretty weird .
Don &apos;t judge , Morty .
Okay .
All right , well ... Look , Mrs. Pancakes is right over there .
I &apos;ll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up .
Whoa , whoa , Morty , the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea .
Listen to me .
If we &apos;re gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes , we have to blend .
I &apos;ll talk to you after lunch .
Ooh , hey !
Ooh , oh !
Oh , man .
Come and join us .
I &apos;m sorry .
No , no .
- Ooh , come here !
- No , thanks !
Ooh , wow !
- Come over here , baby !
- No , I &apos;m okay .
Whoa !
Summer ? !
Hey , there , stranger .
What do you think of these things ?
Ohh !
Oh !
Gross !
Gross !
Whoa , whoa , whoa !
What &apos;s the matter with you , Morty ?
Calm down !
You &apos;re kind of killing the vibe in here .
It &apos;s Summer !
Aw , geez .
Looks like goldenfold has some predilections so shameful he buries them in the dreams of the people in his dreams , including a pervy attraction to your underage sister .
Can you blame him ?
Come on , old man , little boy .
Let &apos;s make an inter-generational sandwich .
Oh , my God .
Oh , my God !
Put some clothes on , for Pete &apos;s sake !
This is disgusting !
- I &apos;m gonna puke !
- I can &apos;t take it , Rick !
Sexual hang-ups in the pleasure chamber are punishable by death !
Off with their heads !
Time to go another dream deep , Morty !
What the hell ?
Why would Mr. goldenfold &apos;s dream version of Mrs. Pancakes &apos; dream version of a centaur be dreaming about a scary place like this , Rick ?
Geez , I don &apos;t know , Morty .
Wha-what do you want from me ?
Welcome to your nightmare , bitch !
- Oh , here we go !
- Holy crap !
Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an &apos; 80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives .
I &apos;m scary Terry .
You can run , but you can &apos;t hide , bitch !
Whoa !
Hey , buddy .
What you got going on there ?
Snuffles fix .
Make better .
Humans understand snuffles now ?
That ... is ... awesome !
Snuffles want to be understood .
Snuffles need to be understood .
Okay , yeah .
I get what Beth was talking about .
Fun &apos;s over .
Whoa , dad , you can &apos;t , like , endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away .
- Why not ?
- I don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s Indian giving .
&lt; i &gt; A sophisticated predator , &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; nature &apos;s perfect killing &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; machine , the vicious wolf &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; stalks its prey with purpose and skill . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; It was only with years of &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; selective breeding and genetic altering &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; that this noble beast was transformed into man &apos;s &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; subservient little buddy . &lt; / i &gt; Aw !
Oh , my God !
He recognizes the other dogs on TV .
&lt; i &gt; &quot; A , &quot; &quot; b &quot; &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; his name is scary Terry &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; &quot; C , &quot; &quot; d &quot; &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; he &apos;s very scary &lt; / i &gt; Holy crap !
We have to escape into someone else &apos;s dreams , Morty !
Oh , man , oh , man , oh , man !
&lt; i &gt; &quot; E , &quot; &quot; f &quot; &lt; / i &gt; he &apos;ll design your death The little girl !
Huh ?
&quot; J , &quot; &quot; k , &quot; he &apos;ll really ruin your day Are you kidding me ?
This again ?
Oh , man , it looks like we &apos;ve hit dream bedrock here , Morty .
Oh , geez , Rick .
W-w-whoa , this isn &apos;t good .
Nothing but fear from here on out , bitch !
Ohhhh !
Holy crap , Morty .
He can travel through dreams .
He can travel through dreams !
We &apos;re so screwed !
Where are my testicles , Summer ?
Where are my testicles , Summer ?
They were removed .
Where have they gone ?
Oh , wow .
That &apos;s an intense line of questioning , snuffles .
Do not call me that !
&quot; Snuffles &quot; was my slave name .
You shall now call me snowball , because my fur is pretty and white .
Okay , snowball , just calm down , okay ?
You &apos;re scaring me .
Scaring you ?
Tell me , Summer , if a human was born with stumpy legs , would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the dachshund ?
Uhhh ... Hey .
Oh , wow .
Okay , is is is everything okay in here ?
Jerry , come to rub my face in urine again ?
No !
No , we were ... uh , just seeing if Summer wanted to ... uh ... Go on , um , one of our famous midnight family walks !
Yeah .
Totally .
Let &apos;s go .
You will walk when it is time to walk .
What are we here for again ?
Incepting ?
We &apos;re trying to incept me to get an &quot; A &quot; in math ?
Oh , yeah .
Buckle up , bitch !
Man , he sure says &quot; bitch &quot; a lot !
You can run , but you can &apos;t hide , bitch !
Hold on , Morty .
Y-you know what ?
He keeps saying we can run but we can hide .
- I say we try hiding .
- But that &apos;s the opposite of what- Yeah , well , since when are we taking this guy &apos;s advice on anything ?
Hey , you know what ?
You got a really good point there , Rick .
Like , if the truth was that we could hide , it &apos;s not like he &apos;d be sharing that information with us , you know ?
I-I-I think it &apos;s a good idea , Rick .
Worst-case scenario we &apos;re back to running .
Wow , you know what ?
I mean , it looks like we could have just hid this whole time .
Boy , Rick , that was some good thinking .
Thanks , Morty .
Yeah , it &apos;s nice to be on the same page every once in a while .
You can run ...
But you can &apos;t hide !
Oh , this is perfect , Morty .
Look at that .
He &apos;s getting sleepy .
Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day .
That &apos;s when we make our move .
Snuffles , we didn &apos;t mean you any harm !
This is a huge misunderstanding .
Dad , he wants to be called snowball .
Well , I &apos;m not calling him that .
That &apos;s ridiculous .
You &apos;re being very aggressive , Jerry .
Perhaps tomorrow Dr. scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery .
You think you can control me with a haircut ?
Hi , honey .
You &apos;re home early .
- How was your day ?
- I don &apos;t want to talk about it !
Oh , of course .
- You never want to talk about it .
- Get off my back , bitch !
Out there .
Not in here .
Yeah , I know , I know .
I shouldn &apos;t take my anger out on you or scary Brandon .
I love you , Melissa .
I love you , too , Terry .
Morty , this is perfect .
After a little scary coitus , they should be fast asleep and then we &apos;ll incept him .
Looks like scary Terry &apos;s having a nightmare .
Oh , boy , Rick .
I can only imagine what horrible things must , you know ... ... scare scary Terry .
Oh , no !
I &apos;m late to class , bitch !
Oh , no !
I &apos;m not wearing any pants !
Ah , well , Mr. Terry , why don &apos;t you tell the whole class the proper wordplay to use when one is chasing one &apos;s victim through a pumpkin patch ?
Oh ... um ...
&quot; Bitch . &quot;
Oh , come on , Terry , you can &apos;t think of a pun involving pumpkins , bitch ?
Hey , leave him alone !
Yeah , this is a bunch of bullcrap .
Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone ?
Why don &apos;t you let the poor guy say whatever he wants ?
Well , I never !
I-I see no reason to stand here and take this .
You &apos;re putting too much pressure on yourself , scary Terry .
You know , I mean , y-you &apos;re perfectly scary enough as it is .
Hey , yo , scary T. , don &apos;t even trip about your pants ... dawg .
Here &apos;s a pair on us , fool .
Aww , bitch .
I don &apos;t know what to say .
You don &apos;t need to say anything .
We got you , dawg .
You &apos;re our boy , dawg .
Don &apos;t even trip .
Oh , hey , it &apos;s you guys !
I haven &apos;t seen him this relaxed in years .
If you guys ever need anything , just say the word .
As a matter of fact , Terry , there is something you could help us with .
&quot; Q , &quot; &quot; r , &quot; you won &apos;t get very far I always hated that song !
These halves don &apos;t belong together , bitch !
Sex is sacred !
This is because you don &apos;t give Morty Smith good grades , bitch !
Holy crap !
God damn !
I know one thing for sure ...
I &apos;m giving Morty an &quot; A &quot; in math , and that &apos;s my idea .
That is an original thought .
What the hell ?
Out of the frying pan dot , dot , dot , huh , Morty ?
Oh , man , what &apos;s going on ?
Well , it &apos;s possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier , then turned on Jerry , Beth , and Summer after learning about humanity &apos;s cruel subjugation of his species , but your guess is as good as mine , Morty .
I can &apos;t believe how mean snuffles got just because he &apos;s smart .
This is why I choose to get C &apos;s .
Psst , Beth , Jerry , Summer .
- Dad !
- Rick !
- Oh , thank God , Morty .
- Oh , you &apos;re welcome .
All right , let &apos;s get out of here .
If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over .
Whoa , whoa , whoa .
We &apos;re not going anywhere .
This is my house .
I &apos;m not abandoning it .
It &apos;s all over , Jerry .
The dogs are on a path to total world domination .
But , hey , at least they know not to piss on your carpet , right ?
Wait a minute .
I have an idea .
Gentlemen , a moment of your time .
See that ?
I &apos;m peeing all over your special guns .
That means I own them .
Bad person .
Bad .
Ooh , great plan , Jerry .
Bring the boy to me .
You were always kind to me , Morty .
That &apos;s why I will leave you with your testicles .
From now on , you will be my best friend and live by my side .
Th-thanks , snuffles .
Begin phase two .
&lt; i &gt; Fighting continues as the dog army captures the eastern seaboard . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; It appears clear at this time ... &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; that the era of human superiority has come to a bitter end . &lt; / i &gt; Please !
Please don &apos;t kill me !
What &apos;s she saying , bill ?
I think she &apos;s saying , &quot; I love lasagna . &quot;
Mmm .
Thank you , Fido .
Rick !
I thought you were dead !
No , no , no , I was just playing dead .
Good news , though , Morty .
This whole thing &apos;s gonna be over really soon .
- What ?
- It &apos;s a dream , Morty .
We &apos;re in your dog &apos;s dream .
The night the dogs captured us , after you cried and crapped your pants , we all went to sleep .
Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles &apos; dream .
But I-it &apos;s been like a whole year !
It &apos;s been six hours .
Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality , and dog time is one-seventh human time .
So , you know , every day here is like a minute .
It &apos;s like &quot; Inception , &quot; Morty , so if it &apos;s confusing and stupid , then so is everyone &apos;s favorite movie .
Aw , man .
I really liked this life .
Well , at least I didn &apos;t really crap my pants .
No , no , that happened before you went to sleep , Morty .
You &apos;re sleeping in your crap right now .
Out of all the things that happened to you , that was the only real thing that , you know , is that you crapped your pants .
I mean , it &apos;s a mess out there .
I got some on my hands , Morty , and then I got it on the dream inceptor , and a piece fell in my mouth .
Aw , man , geez !
Seriously ?
Look , d-d-d-don &apos;t worry about it , Morty .
Here , here take these , Morty .
Take these .
Are these pills supposed to wake me up , or something ?
Close .
It &apos;s gonna make your kidneys shut down .
What ? !
It &apos;s necessary for the plan , Morty .
Don &apos;t even trip , dawg .
It &apos;s pretty bad , emperor snowball .
We &apos;re gonna need to do another operation .
Anything .
Anything for my precious Morty .
Sir , as your accountant , I must advise you that these medical expenses are putting you in serious financial jeopardy .
You could lose your kingdom .
To hell with my kingdom , bean counter .
I would trade it all for my human &apos;s health and happiness .
Do you think they would have done this for us ?
We are not them !
We are not ... them .
Assemble the troops .
I &apos;ve made a decision .
Taking over the human &apos;s world will lead to nothing but more heartbreak , more cruelty .
Instead , we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs , one that will not make the same mistakes as humanity and one where pet insurance will be mandatory .
I &apos;m gonna miss you , snowball .
You can call me snuffles , Morty , and I &apos;m going to miss you , too , very much .
Jerry ?
I &apos;m sorry .
It &apos;s just like the end of &quot; Old Yeller . &quot;
Oh , Jerry .
You mean because it had dogs in it .
Wow !
A whole world populated by intelligent dogs .
I wonder what it &apos;ll be like , Rick .
I think it will be great , Morty .
You know ... it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages .
I mean , I &apos;d watch it , Morty , for at least 11 minutes a pop .
You know , may-maybe they &apos;ll do it board-driven .
You know , that &apos;s a real comforting idea , Rick .
What do you know , Morty ?
What do you know ?
Hi , guys .
I &apos;m your new teacher for scary class .
My name is scary Mr. Johnson .
Uh , actually , you know what ?
That &apos;s my dad &apos;s name , so why don &apos;t you just call me scary Glenn , yeah ?
So , anyway , I understand your previous teacher was having you work on fundamentals of fear .
Which is what is that ?
You know ?
So , uh , here here &apos;s what I say ... you can &apos;t learn anything until you learn ... how to chill .
Oooh !
This is how you dream , bitch .
♪ last king Christmas ♪ ♪ last arrived ♪ ♪ on the Christmas ♪ ♪ Christmas ♪ Mmm .
Jerry , you are really giving it to this ham .
Um , merry Christmas .
Hello ?
My parents are coming over for the first time in years .
Can we stow the gadgets and look alive ?
Alive ?
For your parents ?
- Mm , good one .
- Hey , man !
You &quot; hey , man ! &quot;
This holiday is about humanity .
You know , I thought it was about being born half-God or something .
Whatever .
All electronic items are going in the stocking now .
Dad , I &apos;m not giving you my phone .
Put it in the stocking , Summer , or I &apos;m joining Facebook .
A-ho , ho , ho , everybody .
More like &quot; whoa , whoa , whoa . &quot;
What is this ?
My parents are coming !
Calm down , Jerry .
This is Reuben , an old friend .
Pearl harbor .
I check in on him once a year and give him a little medical evaluation .
Aww !
Dad , that is so sweet !
Yeah , it is .
I don &apos;t get it .
Korea .
Don &apos;t worry about your Christmas , Jerry .
I &apos;ll be with Reuben in my workshop while you guys are having another day in Phil Collins &apos; proverbial paradise .
Huh .
You think you know a guy .
Okay , there &apos;s my parents .
Now , remember no TV , no phones , no laptops .
We are connecting this Christmas , like old-school Jews on a Saturday .
- Hey , hey !
- Merry Christmas , son .
Uh , hi .
Can I help you ?
Jerry , this is Jacob .
Didn &apos;t you get our text message ?
No !
You must be Jerry .
That &apos;s a fine-looking apron .
- Williams-sonoma ?
- I wish !
But thank you .
So , you &apos;re a ... friend of the family ?
Uh , the way we see it , he &apos;s a part of the family .
Wow .
After your father &apos;s brush with cancer and losing your Uncle , we looked at life and wondered , how have we spent it , and how do we spend the rest of it ?
What are we going to be when we die ... a list of fears and questions or a collection of real experiences ?
Holy crap .
Joyce , that &apos;s amazing .
Then Jacob came into our lives , and ... we &apos;re learning to live again .
All three of us .
Cool .
- Eggnog ?
- Now we are talking !
This man &apos;s got the apron and the eggnog , huh ?
Hi , Joyce .
Leonard .
- Hello , there .
- Merry Christmas , man .
Morty , a moment of your time ?
He &apos;s in bad shape , Morty .
Aw , geez , Rick .
What &apos;d you do ?
Gee , thanks , Morty .
What kind of monster do you think I am ?
I &apos;m sitting here trying to save the guy &apos;s life .
I need your help .
I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom .
He &apos;ll know what &apos;s going on .
Uh , where where do I find Dr. Bloom ?
In Reuben .
- Reuben , Minnesota ?
- Reuben on the table , Morty .
Look , I don &apos;t have time for you to wrap your little walnut around everything .
Just hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse .
What proc- - Hey , dad , where &apos;s Morty ?
- He &apos;s busy .
&lt; i &gt; Morty , can you hear me ?
Head north . &lt; / i &gt; Rick , where am I ?
Depending on my aim , you should be just South of the entrance .
Entrance to what ?
Welcome , Morty .
Welcome ... ... to anatomy park !
It &apos;s a little business venture I &apos;ve been cooking up on the side with Dr. Bloom an amusement park inside a human body .
Science isn &apos;t cheap , Morty .
This should really help put a dent in the overhead .
Oh , my God !
This is insane !
Spleen Mountain ?
Bladder falls ?
Pirates of the pancreas ?
You got a problem with that last one , Morty ?
Huh ?
No , no .
I &apos;m just reading &apos; em out loud in the order that I &apos;m seeing &apos; em .
Okay .
All right .
If I sounded a little defensive , it &apos;s because ... pirates of the pancreas was my baby .
You know , I got I got a lot of pushback when I pitched it , Morty .
I guess I &apos;m still a little defensive .
Let &apos;s just find Dr. Bloom , all right ?
I &apos;m picking up a distress signal in the liver , Morty .
Proceed to the liver .
&lt; i &gt; Arriving at ... &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; ... liver . &lt; / i &gt; Ow !
&lt; i &gt; Mind the gap . &lt; / i &gt; It &apos;s really scary in here , Rick .
&lt; i &gt; The liver &apos;s under maintenance . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Reuben &apos;s seen some rough years , Morty . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Don &apos;t judge . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; You don &apos;t agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life &apos;s going great . &lt; / i &gt; Rick !
It &apos;s a monster !
&lt; i &gt; No , no , no .
Morty . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; The only monster here is alco ...... holism . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; That is an animatronic werewolf . &lt; / i &gt; Who are you ? !
Answer me !
Where &apos;d you come from ?
My my my grandpa Rick sent me !
Poncho !
That &apos;s quite enough .
Morty , that &apos;s Poncho .
This is Roger and Annie .
And I am Dr. Xenon Bloom .
&lt; i &gt; Hey , Bloom , it &apos;s Rick . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; What the hell &apos;s going on here ? &lt; / i &gt; I don &apos;t know why , but the entire security system has shut down , and I &apos;m afraid ... the exhibits are unlocked .
Exhibits ?
Anatomy park &apos;s greatest attraction , young man , isn &apos;t the music or the food or the ... Pirates of the pancreas .
&lt; i &gt; Watch it . &lt; / i &gt; It is , first and foremost , a living museum of humanity &apos;s most noble and ferocious diseases .
Diseases ?
Hey , doc .
I got news for you .
Your living museum is officially a wild safari !
Hepatitis A !
Run !
Oh , the food goes in your mouth , girl .
Oh , Jacob .
I &apos;m sorry , Jacob .
I guess I &apos;m still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents .
Are you , like , uh are you , like , their caretaker ?
Is that what it is ?
- We can go into detail later , son .
- Now , wait .
Th-there &apos;s no point to secrecy .
Let &apos;s all live and die honestly .
Your mother and I have shared 40 years of each other , mind , body , and soul , and when minds and souls are joined for eternity and when eternity is at the door , it &apos;s an invitation to let go of the body and an opportunity to share and experiment .
Dad , please .
What are you saying ?
Whatever it is , it &apos;s beautiful , Leonard , and we support you .
Hey , speak for yourself , because it ... sounds like you &apos;re about to say Jacob is your lover .
No , no , no , no , no , no .
Jacob is your mother &apos;s lover .
I watch them sometimes ... from a chair and sometimes from a closet , almost always dressed as superman .
Oh .
Jerry , this ham has got to be all you , right ?
It &apos;s incredible .
Happy human holiday , dad .
Aah !
Hepatitis won &apos;t follow us into the respiratory system .
That &apos;s strange .
Airflow is down 20 % .
So , the brain isn &apos;t getting enough oxygen .
That &apos;s why security &apos;s offline .
Well , I guess we better check it out .
Hey !
Wait for me !
Put that back on !
If we got up to the bronchial catwalk , we could look for a blockage .
I &apos;ll go .
- Don &apos;t be a hero , kid .
- I &apos;m not .
I &apos;m doing it because it &apos;s fun .
We shouldn &apos;t be here .
Whatever you do , do not fire that thing in here .
We must save Reuben .
This is my life &apos;s work .
It &apos;s all right , my dear .
Nearly all human lungs contain ... a strain of these bacteria , but the scar tissue keeps them ... Dormant .
- Morty , get down !
- Whoa-ho-ho !
Whoa !
Whoa , whoa , whoa !
Oh , what are those things ?
Tuberculosis coming in fast !
Not faster than a bullet !
Aah !
No !
Do you know what you &apos;ve done ? !
Whoa !
Get to the digestive tract !
He &apos;s coughing !
Whoaaaa !
Don &apos;t let me die !
Just take a deep breath , Reuben .
You &apos;re not gonna die !
What &apos;s your name ?
My name is ... Alexand- Rick r-r-Reuben &apos;s got tuberculosis !
Oh , great work , Morty .
Okay , I &apos;ll just cure it and then- Okay .
Well , I can &apos;t cure death .
This is bad , Morty .
You &apos;re trapped in a dead man .
Listen , if the situation keeps darkening , do yourself a favor and pop by pirates of the pancreas .
Obviously I &apos;m biased , but I think it &apos;s great , Morty .
It &apos;s a bunch of Pirates running around a Pancreas .
We don &apos;t whitewash it , either , Morty .
I mean , the pirates are really rapey .
The top priority is to get , you know , you guys out of there , but I &apos;m just saying , if that becomes impossible , please , you gotta treat yourself .
Oh , man .
What is that horrible smell ?
You mean the panda express ?
Kidding .
I-I &apos;m kidding .
The body is beginning to constrict and fill with gas .
We &apos;re inside a corpse , my boy .
Anatomy park is doomed .
Forget about the park , doctor !
How do we get out ?
The digestive tract is the evacuation route .
Get it ?
There &apos;s an emergency station in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all .
Everybody , head for the colon !
Now I &apos;m taking orders from a 12-year-old boy ?
Morty , the scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged .
This disaster was an inside job .
Keep your eye on Annie .
She was written up several times by her manager at the churro stand .
Intestines are ahead to the left , then to the right , then left , et cetera .
Hey , just so you know , I &apos;m actually 14 .
So , you know ... What ?
- Not 12 .
- Okay .
You know , because he just said I was 12 .
Oh .
Good for you .
&lt; i &gt; Oof .
Ugh .
Morty .
Strike one . &lt; / i &gt; ♪ It &apos;s a road of wonder ♪ ♪ a trail of food ♪ ♪ it &apos;s a pathway to break up ♪ ♪ the bad and good ♪ ♪ it &apos;s a tube that digests ♪ ♪ and then sends out the rest ♪ ♪ it &apos;s a small , small ♪ ♪ intestine ♪ It goes on like this for miles .
Then we get to the large intestine !
Shh !
I hear something .
Don &apos;t move .
Gonorrhea can &apos;t see us if we don &apos;t move .
Wait , I was wrong .
I was thinking of a T. Rex .
Move !
We &apos;re sitting ducks !
Doc , didn &apos;t you say that the body was filling with gas ?
- Yes .
Why ?
- Kid , you &apos;re a genius .
Are you mad ? !
Everybody , in here !
Hey , gonorrhea !
How &apos;s this for a burning sensation ?
Huh .
♪ Drummer drum drum ♪ ♪ drum drum drum ♪ ♪ drum drum drum drum drum drum ♪ ♪ Christmas drums ♪ Oh , sing it , Summer .
♪ Christmas drums ♪ ♪ being played by a Bo-o-o-y ♪ Oh , I love to hear you sing .
Jerry , come on .
This is what you wanted .
I get it , Beth .
Be careful what you wish for .
I &apos;m being punished for taking your iPad .
What ?
Jerry , let that stuff go , okay ?
I &apos;m sorry I was a bitch earlier .
Let &apos;s just be here .
- Summer !
- Ethan ?
What are you doing here ?
I &apos;ve been texting you for hours !
What the hell ? !
I don &apos;t have my phone !
I &apos;m doing a human holiday !
Well , did you even consider how that might make me feel ? !
How you feel ? !
Why is everything always happening to you ? !
Summer , do you have a boyfriend ?
Yeah , do you , Summer ?
I don &apos;t know , Ethan .
Do I ? !
Jerry , no disrespect , but you really need to connect more with your family , man .
I should be able to access ... the backup generator to get the growth ray online .
If it works , we &apos;ll be regular-sized in a few minutes .
I just hope Reuben &apos;s not in a room with white carpets or upholstery .
- What the hell is that ?
- The sphincter dam .
We built it when Reuben became incontinent , but it was not designed to hold a corpse load .
I &apos;ve almost got it .
Everybody , move inside the circle .
Poncho ?
What is this in your backpack ?
That &apos;s bubonic plague !
What are you doing with that , Poncho ?
Everybody , get back !
Poncho , you son of a bitch !
You released the tuberculosis so you could steal from me ?
That &apos;s right , baby .
A lot of people would pay top dollar to decimate the population .
I &apos;ll take the highest bidder ... Al-qaeda , North Korea , Republicans , shriners , balding men that work out , people on the Internet that are only turned on ... by cartoons of Japanese teenagers .
Anything is better than working for you , you pompous , negligent , iTunes-gift-card-as-a-holiday- bonus-giving mother- Come on !
Aah !
Get off !
You guys !
It &apos;s gonna burst !
Go !
Go , go , go !
- My foot is stuck .
- No !
It &apos;s okay !
It &apos;s okay .
Just go .
Tell my family I love them .
They may be hard to find &apos; cause my wife ... kept her last name and she made the kids take it , too , so , I-I don &apos;t know , you can- No !
Let me ask you a question , Ethan .
Where &apos;s the anger coming from , man ?
From Summer being a total bitch !
Where &apos;s the anger coming from ?
My brother ... took me fishing once ... in the bushes ...
I can &apos;t ...
I can &apos;t ...
He made me feel like a girl !
He made me a girl !
He didn &apos;t make you anything , man .
You are who you are .
She is who she is .
Now , you go to her ... brand-new .
Come here , right now .
Oh , my God .
I &apos;m so sorry , Ethan !
I love you !
I love you so much .
Um ... You did it again , cubbie .
Come here .
No !
Stop !
I hate this !
Well , Christmas doesn &apos;t revolve around what you hate , son .
Well , then I hate Christmas !
Enjoy being human !
You guys are gross and lame .
My name &apos;s Reuben Ridley .
You &apos;re inside me right now , but by the end of this journey ... Whoopsie .
I &apos;ll be inside all of you .
My story begins during the dot-com crash in the early &apos; 90s .
You can put your fingers wherever you want .
&lt; i &gt; Morty , you want to put it on mute or something ? &lt; / i &gt; I &apos;m I &apos;m trying to concentrate .
Uh ... Rick ?
Not now , Jerry .
I &apos;ve got much , much smaller fish to fry .
I wanted to say I &apos;m sorry I ever judged you .
Right now , you &apos;re my sanest relative .
Relative .
Relative size !
Jerry , hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite .
Morty , can you get to the left nipple ?
Are you kidding ?
I &apos;m hoping I can get to both of &apos; em , Rick .
&lt; i &gt; No , Morty , I &apos;m talking about Reuben &apos;s left nipple . &lt; / i &gt; We need to get to the left nipple !
The body is decaying .
The arterial transit system is useless .
We can try the service shuttle .
It &apos;s connected to the skeletal system .
That &apos;s why we call it the bone train .
Would you like to ride the bone train , miss ?
If it &apos;ll get us out of here .
How about you , Morty ?
Would you like to ride the bone train ?
Why are you doing this bit ?
We &apos;re gonna die !
Let &apos;s go !
Well ...
I can see you &apos;re busy .
Merry Christmas , Rick .
There &apos;s no autopilot .
One of us will have to stay here and operate it manually .
Uh , well ... No , you &apos;re you &apos;re right .
It was a dick move for me to even pause like that .
This is all my fault .
You go on .
What the hell is that ?
E. Coli outbreak .
Hurry !
- Wait , there is an autopilot .
- Wait !
It &apos;s okay !
Never mind !
I wanted to sacrifice myself anyway !
They &apos;re they &apos;re chewing through the doors !
We &apos;re in the areola , Rick , almost to the nipple , but we &apos;re also in a really bad situation !
&lt; i &gt; I &apos;m almost there , Morty ! &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Reports from all over the &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; country have been coming in &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; about what appears to be ... &lt; / i &gt; a giant , naked man over the continental United States .
We now go to Tom Randolph in New York .
Tom ?
Well , the eyes aren &apos;t twinkling and the dimples aren &apos;t merry , but I &apos;m standing under a nose like a 70-mile cherry .
Thank you , Tom .
Let &apos;s go now to Eric McMahan in Los Angeles .
We &apos;ve got feet here on the west coast , Bill , giant feet , even relative to the giant man &apos;s size , and you know what they say about that .
Well , if the old adage is true , one can only wonder what &apos;s going down in the rocky mountains .
Wha ?
Oh my God , the track !
It &apos;s Hepatitis A !
Aaaah !
The nipple hole .
It &apos;s beautiful .
- Oh , no !
- Holy crap !
Whoa !
It &apos;s Hepatitis C !
Um ... wait did we have some sort of relationship with him ?
I think they &apos;re just like that ?
I think they &apos;re just good guys .
Oh .
Huh .
Where &apos;s Dr. Bloom ?
I &apos;m sorry , Rick , but he &apos;s dead .
God damn it , Morty .
I ask you to do one thing !
Jerry doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s missing .
He &apos;ll come around , Beth .
Christmas is a special time .
It has funny ways of bringing families together .
I don &apos;t know , Jacob .
Jerry got an invitation to be alive today , and he rejected it .
I don &apos;t know if our marriage will ...
It &apos;s raining blood !
Oh , shit .
Find Jerry .
Oh , God .
- Jerry !
- It &apos;s all right .
The TV says there &apos;s nothing to worry about .
The giant , naked sky Santa has exploded .
Blood and chunks of viscera are raining down on the country .
Everything should be fine .
Oh , yes .
Dad , can I have my phone back ?
A sure , sweetie .
Here .
Everybody , take a device .
It &apos;ll help you relax .
- This is nice .
- Yeah .
Look , I guess we really learned something this Christmas , Jacob .
No , we didn &apos;t , dad .
No , we didn &apos;t .
Too bad about Dr. Bloom .
He was a genius the only man capable of creating a new anatomy park .
Actually , I studied Dr. Bloom &apos;s work .
I believe I have the knowledge necessary to create an entirely new , much safer park .
What about ... Pirates of the pancreas ?
I think it was one of the most underrated attractions .
Boo-yah !
Hold your breath .
Hey , what the hell , Rick ? !
What the hell , man !
I liked her !
I really had something going there , Rick !
Yeah , so I heard .
You dodged a bullet , Morty , trust me .
- Puffy vagina .
- What &apos;s wrong with that ?
That doesn &apos;t sound like a problem to me .
I don &apos;t know .
Come on , let &apos;s get some stuffing .
I &apos;m starving .
Oh , unbelievable .
We got we got a bunch of robot , computer people , sitting around with their faces stuffed into computer screens .
Do you guys realize that Christ was born today ?
Jesus Christ , our savior , was born today .
Are are are you people even human ?
What kind of Christmas is this ?
&lt; i &gt; Hey , Rick ?
Rick , can you hear me ? &lt; / i &gt; Loud and clear , Annie .
&lt; i &gt; Great . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; We &apos;re also on with Alejandro , our chief imaginarian . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Hey , Rick . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Natalie Jacobs and Chris Deseter from microscopic marketing , &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Zack from organ concepts , and Jamie from new media . &lt; / i &gt; Hey , everybody .
&lt; i &gt; - Hi , how &apos;s it going ?
- Hi , Rick . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; So , pirates of the pancreas . &lt; / i &gt; Yeah .
Talk to me .
&lt; i &gt; Hey , Rick .
It &apos;s Alejandro speaking . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Um , so , we asked ourselves , &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; internally we asked ourselves over here , &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; &quot; okay , what does a pancreas do ?
&quot; &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; And the answer was , &quot; does it make pirates ?
&quot; &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; No , it makes Insulin , you know ? &lt; / i &gt; - &lt; i &gt; So , we &apos;re starting with a new- &lt; / i &gt; - Those guys are inside me , huh ?
Like , building a park ?
Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit , Ethan !
They &apos;re inside you building a monument to compromise !
Those people .
This whole thing , Ethan .
Cool .
And who pays me ?
This is just sloppy craftsmanship .
Hey , Rick .
Boy , sure is really especially beautiful out there today , huh ?
Oh , yes , Morty .
It &apos;s almost unbelievable , isn &apos;t it ?
Yeah , you know ?
There &apos;s something about the air and just the way the sunshine is .
Uh , sure , buddy .
Yeah .
Sure .
Brilliant .
- Very convincing .
- Convincing ?
Oh .
Responsive , too .
In real time .
I love it .
Uhh ... okay .
I &apos;m going to work .
Morty , good morning .
Dad , good morning .
I am going to work .
Goodbye .
- What &apos;s with mom ?
- Oh , what &apos;s with mom ?
So , you &apos;re saying that she &apos;s acting weird ?
How sophisticated .
Careful , guys .
You &apos;re gonna burn out the CPU with this one .
Okay , you know what , Rick ?
You &apos;re acting weird , too .
Whatever , quote-unquote &quot; Morty . &quot;
All right , well ...
I &apos;ll see you after school .
Ow !
Oof !
Ugh !
Damn it !
I &apos;m all right .
I &apos;m okay .
All right , who can tell me what 5 x 9 is ?
Morty ?
Uh , me ?
What is 5 x 9 ?
Umm ... you know , it &apos;s uhh ... at least 40 .
Morty , that &apos;s exactly correct !
5 x 9 is at least 40 !
Come up here .
Whoo !
Way to go , Morty !
Everybody , this is the best student .
I want you to be the teacher today .
Teach us , Morty !
Interesting .
What do you want me to teach you ?
Ooh , ooh !
How do you make concentrated dark matter ?
Oh , that &apos;s a good question .
Concentrated huh ?
Concentrated dark matter the fuel for accelerated space travel .
Now , do you know how to make it ?
Umm ... Come on , Morty .
Isn &apos;t your grandpa , like , a scientist ?
Oh , yeah , but , you know , he told me that I shouldn &apos;t go around spouting off about , you know , his science and stuff .
I bet you &apos;ve seen him make concentrated dark matter a lot .
You know , if you tell us , I &apos;ll be your girlfriend .
Uh , y-you will ?
Seems like a rare opportunity , Morty .
Morty , u-uh , come on .
- There &apos;s a family emergency .
- Stop right there !
If he leaves , I &apos;m giving him an &quot; F &quot; .
- He doesn &apos;t care .
- Aw , man !
Rick , I have to go back !
I think I was about to get married !
Ugh !
Take a shower with me , Morty .
- What ? !
- Listen to me , Morty .
Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now .
