You got to trust me , Morty .
Ugh !
I &apos;m gonna get an &quot; F &quot; in class , Rick .
Morty , that &apos;s not class .
That wasn &apos;t your teacher .
This isn &apos;t your school .
This entire world is not the world .
We &apos;re inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship .
Wait a minute .
W-what are you talking about ?
It &apos;s all fake , Morty all of it .
Nanobotic renderings , a bunch of crazy fake nonsense , Morty .
I couldn &apos;t say so until we got in the shower .
They won &apos;t monitor us in here .
Monitor us ? !
W-who ? !
Zigerion scammers , Morty .
The galaxy &apos;s most ambitious , least successful con artists .
You know , it &apos;s lucky for us they &apos;re also really uncomfortable with nudity .
Aw , come on , Rick .
If everyone &apos;s just gonna be insane today , at least let me be insane with Jessica .
I can &apos;t let you do that , Morty .
Give it to me !
No !
You give it to me !
G-g-give it !
No , Rick !
Oh , God , sir !
They &apos;re still naked !
Ugh .
Well , check every five quintons and tell me when they &apos;re not .
I think we should make Kevin look , sir .
What ? !
No !
Why would you even say that ?
Uh , sir , we have a situation over here .
If there &apos;s a wiener on that monitor , I swear to God , stu ... Something is drawing a lot of processing power .
Oh , wait .
No wonder .
There &apos;s another real human in the simulator .
Okay , Jerry big pitch meeting .
Make-or-break time .
You can do this .
How did this happen ? !
Where &apos;s the abductions department ?
Hey , man , abductions just follows the acquisition order .
Don &apos;t put this on acquisitions !
We only acquire humans that haven &apos;t been simulated !
Well , simulations doesn &apos;t simulate anybody that &apos;s been abducted , so ... Oh , I see !
Oh , oh !
It was no one &apos;s fault .
Oh , okay .
I &apos;m sorry .
Well , then , problem solved .
Oh , wait no .
There &apos;s still another human in here !
Who is he ?
Rick &apos;s son-in-law , Jerry Smith .
So far , he hasn &apos;t noticed he &apos;s in a simulation .
Well , cap his sector at 5 % processing , keep his settings on auto , and we &apos;ll deal with him later .
Rick Sanchez is the target .
Got to relax .
It &apos;s just a pitch .
Got to relax .
&lt; i &gt; This is earth radio . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; And now , here &apos;s ... human music . &lt; / i &gt; Hmm .
Human music .
I like it .
Rick !
Uhp , uhp , uhp !
Morty , keep your hands off your ding-dong !
It &apos;s the only way we can speak freely .
Look around you , Morty .
Do you really think this world is real ?
You &apos;d have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details .
Look that guy &apos;s putting a bun between two hot dogs .
I don &apos;t know , Rick .
I mean , I &apos;ve seen people do that before .
Well , look at that old lady .
She &apos;s she &apos;s walking a cat on a leash .
Uh , Mrs. Spencer does that all the time , Rick .
Look , I-I-I don &apos;t want to hear about Mrs. Spencer , Morty !
She &apos;s an idiot !
All right , all right , there .
What about that , Morty ?
Okay , okay , you got me on that one .
Oh , really , Morty ?
Are you sure you haven &apos;t seen that somewhere in real life before ?
No , no .
I haven &apos;t seen that .
I mean , why would a pop tart want to live inside a toaster , Rick ?
I mean , that would be , like , the scariest place for them to live .
You know what I mean ?
You &apos;re missing the point , Morty .
Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels ?
I mean , does your car look like a smaller version of your house ?
No .
So , why are they doing this ?
W-what do they want ?
Well , that would be obvious to you , Morty , if you &apos;d been paying attention .
We got the President of the United States in here !
We need 10cc of concentrated dark matter , stat , or he &apos;ll die !
Concentrated dark matter ?
They were asking about that in class .
Yeah , it &apos;s a special fuel I invented to travel through space faster than anybody else .
These zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets , but they made a big mistake this time , Morty .
They dragged you into this .
- Now they &apos;re gonna pay !
- What do you ... What are we gonna do ?
We &apos;ll scam the scammers , Morty .
And we &apos;re gonna take them for everything they &apos;ve got .
National apple farmers of America , welcome to our ad agency .
I &apos;m Jerry Smith .
All right .
I &apos;ll just ... get to the pitch .
Um , simple question , gentlemen , what are apples ?
Excuse me .
What are apples ?
Apples are food .
And ... when do we need food ?
When we &apos;re hungry .
With that , I give you your new slogan !
Well , say something !
- Do you like it ?
- Yes .
- You do ?
- Yes .
So ...
I sold it ?
I sold the idea ?
- Yes .
- Oh , my God !
Thank you !
- Thank you .
- You &apos;re welcome .
Hey !
I just sold my first pitch !
Slow down !
Lookin &apos; good .
My man !
Hello .
Guess who just sold the apples campaign .
Who just sold the apples campaign ?
Me !
I guess it wasn &apos;t a rip-off of &quot; got milk ? &quot;
after all .
- Guess someone was wrong .
- Yes .
Well , all is forgiven , because right now , I &apos;ve got an erection the size of an east coast lighthouse , and I &apos;m coming home to share it with my beautiful wife .
- Okay .
- Wait really ?
- Yes .
- Yes !
See you in 10 minutes !
Hey !
I &apos;m going to make love to my wife !
Lookin &apos; good .
- Slow down !
- My man !
Aw , geez , Rick .
I don &apos;t know if I like this plan , you know ?
I mean , crowds , they have a tendency to make me really nervous .
Morty , relax .
It &apos;s just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there .
You &apos;re gonna be fine .
Just follow my lead .
Yo , deejay , drop that beat .
Uh-oh , Morty .
This crowd looks too small for one of our famous rap concerts .
I don &apos;t think we can perform our new song , &quot; the recipe for concentrated dark matter &quot; , for a crowd this tiny .
You got that right , Rick .
Now that &apos;s more like it !
Morty , here we go .
Let me hear everybody say &quot; hey-oh ! &quot;
Yeah !
All the ladies say , &quot; yeah ! &quot;
Everybody over 30 , do this with your hands !
Everybody with a red shirt , jump up and down !
Yeah , don &apos;t move .
Yo , everyone whose first name begins with an &quot; L &quot; who isn &apos;t hispanic , walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times 10 !
Run , Morty !
Before the system reboots !
Yeah !
You like that ?
Now who &apos;s unremarkable ?
You hungry for apples ?
Are you hungry ... for ...
apples ? !
Oh , my God .
That &apos;s the best sex I &apos;ve ever had in my life .
It &apos;s ... it &apos;s ... too good .
I don &apos;t deserve this , Beth .
I &apos;m a fraud .
Oh , man , Rick !
Where we running to ?
Out of the simulation , Morty .
Normally , the chamber operates like a treadmill , with the virtual world disappearing behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it , but while it &apos;s frozen , Morty , we can get to ...
The edge .
Here we go .
Holy crap !
Come on , Morty .
Sir , they &apos;re over the edge .
Yes , they are .
Just ... as ... planned .
Oh , this is going to be such a mind- Keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room , Morty .
That &apos;s how we &apos;re gonna scam these idiots .
So , hey , why do these aliens keep coming after you , Rick , if you &apos;re so much smarter than them ?
It &apos;s an obsession for them at this point .
The zigerions have been trying to outsmart me for years , Morty .
Every time they do , I &apos;m one step ahead of them .
Aha !
Here we go .
Grab as many processors as you can carry , Morty .
These guys aren &apos;t good at much , but they &apos;re really good at making these chips .
I &apos;ve got so many , I can barely hold them all .
Look at look at this .
Oops .
I dropped one .
Don &apos;t worry about it , Morty .
There &apos;s plenty of them , you little goofball .
Come here , Morty !
Oh , I gotcha !
Come on , quit it , Rick !
Quit it !
Nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then , little fella .
Wow .
What do you know ?
Huh .
That was easy .
Totes malotes , dawg .
Just kind of hard to believe , you know ?
Believe it , Morty .
And once again , I &apos;m flying away with everything I can carry , and the zigerions got nothing of mine .
Mr. Marklevitz , do you have a ... minute to talk ?
Yes .
Look , I &apos;m a fraud .
I mean , let &apos;s face it , &quot; hungry for apples &quot; is just a rip-off of &quot; got milk ? &quot;
It &apos;s almost identical .
- Yes .
- Okay .
I deserve that .
Umm ...
I guess ...
I &apos;ll just pack up my desk .
Yes .
Oh , my God .
Wait .
You know what ? !
No !
The milk people don &apos;t have a patent on simple rhetorical questions !
There &apos;s not even a single word in &quot; hungry for apples &quot; that &apos;s shared by &quot; got milk ? &quot; .
It &apos;s a completely different slogan .
It &apos;s different !
And I shouldn &apos;t be fired .
- I should be promoted !
- Yes .
Yeah !
Wait .
Really ?
- Yes .
- Yes !
I mean , I &apos;m it may be derivative , but it &apos;s the most successful campaign to come out - of this agency in a long time .
- Yes .
I &apos;m not saying it should win an award for commercials , but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples , like ... an appley or something .
Yes .
Is there really an award called the appley for apple-related ad campaigns ?
Yes .
- Could we nominate me ?
- Yes .
Holy crap !
Get in , Morty .
I &apos;m gonna be able to use these processors to make some real important science stuff .
Huh .
I thought I entered the code right .
Wha well , what &apos;s this ?
What could this possibly be ?
Because it looks like you &apos;re inside a simulation ...
Inside a simulation .
You &apos;re still on the ship .
Game-day bucket go boom .
Sir , the , uh , doctor &apos;s appointment to examine the discoloration on your butthole flaps was- Too loud , Cynthia .
Too loud and too specific .
We &apos;ve known how to make concentrated dark matter for a long time .
But now we also know the code to your fabled safe , Rick Sanchez !
All your most valuable secrets will now be ours !
Uh , yeah , until I get home before you , and change the combination , you bunch of idiots !
That is why you &apos;re never getting home .
Get them !
Run , Morty !
Oh , my God !
Ow !
I got to tell you , this morning , I didn &apos;t even know this award existed .
Now I &apos;m holding one .
And ... um ... Look , I want to say that today was the best day of my life ...
But ... the truth is , it &apos;s more meaningful than that .
&lt; i &gt; My man ! &lt; / i &gt; Yes .
Thank you , sir .
I ... am ... finally complete !
&lt; i &gt; My my my my man ! &lt; / i &gt; What the hell ? !
No .
- Jerry ? !
- Dad !
What are you doing here ?
Why are you dressed like a waiter ?
Screw it .
We don &apos;t have time .
- Come on .
- No !
Ohhhhh !
Aah !
Yes !
Yes !
Yes !
Oof !
Man up , Jerry !
I may need you to work the lasers .
Oh , man !
They &apos;re hot on our tail , Rick !
I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter .
Well , you know how to make it , too , right , Rick ?
Yeah .
Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Uh , check the engine room .
We just need cesium , plutonic quarks , and bottled water .
It &apos;s all here , Rick !
Wow , Morty .
Lucky break .
Grab that bucket .
Okay , two parts plutonic quarks , one part cesium .
Okay .
Uh-huh .
All right .
Now empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here !
What are you doing , Morty ? !
There &apos;s no time !
Oh , no .
What the- No !
Oh , my God , Rick .
How dumb are you ?
You &apos;re inside a simulation ... Of a simulation ...
Inside another giant simulation !
We never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter .
But we do now !
We do now , sucka !
You simulated my grandson &apos;s genitalia ? !
You bunch of diabolical sons of bitches !
Kevin fought real hard to supervise that project .
You said you weren &apos;t gonna tell anyone !
I &apos;m never gonna live this down , am I ?
All right .
Okay .
All right , great .
Wonderful .
You win .
Can we go home now ?
I don &apos;t know .
Can you ?
Ha !
Nice .
Okay , okay .
Show this gullible turd to his shuttle .
I &apos;m done with him .
Oh , wait .
Let me get a picture .
Aww .
Look at his face .
He &apos;s trying to figure out if he &apos;s in a simulation still .
Are you , Rick ?
Are you ?
You &apos;re not .
Or are you ?
Oh , and , by the way , I don &apos;t have discolored butthole flaps .
That was part of the simulation .
Oh .
Uh , sir , should I cancel that appointment , then ?
Yeah !
Of course you should !
No , keep it .
Move it up , actually , if you can .
Hey , Jerry , don &apos;t worry about it .
So what if the most meaningful day of your life was ... a simulation operating at minimum capacity ?
You know what , Rick ?
Those guys took you for a ride , too .
You should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe , now that you &apos;re one of us .
Maybe you &apos;re right , Jerry .
Maybe you &apos;re right .
All right , everybody .
Two parts plutonic quarks ... One part cesium ... And listen , I &apos;m sorry for yelling earlier .
I couldn &apos;t ask for a better staff .
I love you guys , and I love all your families .
And the final ingredient ... Whoa !
What the hell ? !
What happened back there ?
Why don &apos;t you ask the smartest people in the universe , Jerry ?
Oh , yeah .
You can &apos;t .
They blew up .
So ... What do you think ?
You &apos;re fired .
Wha- But this idea was tested in a state-of-the-art simulation .
Well , then , it was a terrible simulation .
Get out .
Man , how does a guy like that go home and have sex with his wife ?
Hey , Morty .
What ?
Hey , little buddy .
How you doing in here right now ?
Aw , geez , Rick .
What are you doing , man ?
You &apos;re a good kid , Morty .
You &apos;re a real little character , Morty .
Oh , boy .
You know , I had a really rocky road today , Morty .
You &apos;re my little friend , aren &apos;t you ?
We had some good times together , Morty ?
You &apos;re a real true hero out in the field .
You &apos;re a real trouper , huh , Morty ?
Have you been drinking , Rick ?
I really appreciate you , Morty .
Okay , cool .
All right , Rick you little son of a bitch !
Are you a simulation ? !
Huh ? !
Are you a simulation ? !
No !
No !
No !
You little son of a bitch !
I &apos;m sorry , Morty .
You &apos;re a good you &apos;re a good kid , Morty .
Geez !
You &apos;re a good you &apos;re a good kid .
Oh , my God !
What the hell ?
What a life .
Run !
Morty , do it !
Hit the button now !
I can &apos;t do it , Rick !
They &apos;re my parents and sister !
Morty , I already told you it &apos;s not your family !
They &apos;re clones from an alternate reality , possessed by demonic alien spirits from another dimension &apos;s future !
Do you need a mnemonic device or something ?
Just hit the button , already !
Morty , please , I love you , sweetheart .
Oh !
Good work , Morty .
You know , these demonic alien spirits are really valuable .
You okay , Morty ?
I told you not to trust that tuna .
I just killed my family !
I don &apos;t care what they were .
I don &apos;t know , Morty .
Some people &apos;d pay top dollar for that kind of breakthrough .
You know what , Rick ?
That &apos;s it !
I &apos;m done with these insane adventures !
That was really traumatizing !
- I quit !
I &apos;m out !
- Whoa , whoa , whoa !
Come on , Morty , don &apos;t be like that .
The universe is a crazy , chaotic place .
You &apos;re the one that &apos;s crazy and chaotic !
Adventures are supposed to be simple and fun .
Oh , yeah , Morty , yeah .
Yeah , that that that &apos;s real easy to say from the sidekick position .
But but , uh , how about next time ... you be in charge , and then we &apos;ll talk about how simple and fun it is ?
Seriously , Rick ?
You &apos;ll you &apos;ll let me call the shots ?
Okay , yeah , fine .
But let &apos;s make it interesting , Morty .
If your adventure sucks and we bail halfway through it , you lose the right to bitch about all future adventures .
Plus , you have to do my laundry for a month .
Okay , all right , tough guy !
But if my adventure &apos;s good ...
I get to be in charge of every third adventure !
- Every 10th .
- Deal .
All right .
Well , come on , let &apos;s get going .
Dad , the dishwasher &apos;s doing that thing again .
- Washing dishes ?
- No .
The opposite .
Can you fix it ?
Grandpa Rick , can you help me with my science homework ?
- Yeah just don &apos;t do it .
- Grandpa !
Hey , Rick , you got some kind of hand-shaped device that can open this mayonnaise jar ?
Wow .
Hat trick .
All right , Morty , let &apos;s put a pin in this .
I got to help your pathetic family .
Oh , that sounds like something a chicken would say .
Bawk , bawk , bawk , bawk , bawk , bawk .
Oh , Morty , you done did it this time .
It &apos;s on .
I can &apos;t wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart .
As for you dingdongs ...
This is a Meeseeks box .
Let me show you how it works .
You press this .
I &apos;m Mr. Meeseeks !
Look at me !
You make a request .
Mr. Meeseeks , open Jerry &apos;s stupid mayonnaise jar .
Yes , siree !
The Meeseeks fulfills the request .
- All done !
- Wow !
And then it stops existing .
- Oh , my God , he exploded !
- Trust me , they &apos;re fine with it .
Knock yourselves out just keep your requests simple .
They &apos;re not gods .
All right !
Get out of here now !
Everybody out of here !
I got a bet to win !
- So many possibilities .
- My mind is racing .
If we &apos;re gonna use this thing , which I &apos;m not even sure we should , we need to keep it simple .
- I &apos;m Mr. Meeseeks !
- I want to be popular at school !
- Ooh , okay !
- Summer , what did I just- Ooh , I &apos;m Mr. Meeseeks !
Look at me !
I want I want to be a more complete woman !
- Beth !
- Oh , yeah !
Yes , ma &apos;am !
You guys are doing it wrong .
He said &quot; simple . &quot;
Hey , there .
I &apos;m Mr. Meeseeks !
Mr. Meeseeks , I would like to take two strokes off my golf game .
Ooh , yeah !
Can do !
Nailed it .
God , Morty , what a boring start to an adventure .
Why didn &apos;t we just go to Kentucky ?
Rick , this is a fantasy-type world with creatures and all sorts of fantasy things .
- We &apos;re going on a quest , okay ?
- Can &apos;t wait .
Ahem .
Excuse me !
We are two humble heroes in search of adventure !
Oh , my God , so embarrassing .
At last !
Two heroes !
You must help us !
This village is terribly poor , yet the giant that lives in the clouds above has untold treasures !
You know what ?
I accept your call to adventure , good sir , kind sir .
Come on , Rick .
- There &apos;s a giant in the clouds !
- Yeah .
Beginner &apos;s luck .
In conclusion , a friendship with Summer Smith is the most valuable and enriching experience of your young lives .
I &apos;m Mr. Meeseeks !
Look at me !
Thank you !
Uh , Mr. Meeseeks , was it ?
Yeah .
Gene Vagina .
Listen , I &apos;m in a bit of custody thing with my ex and was wondering- No , I &apos;ll get your info from Summer .
I got pregnant at 17 .
I mean , I still put myself through veterinary school .
Yes , I &apos;m successful , but what if I hadn &apos;t ...
I &apos;m just saying , somewhere along the way , I lost that wide-eyed girl from muskegon .
She &apos;s still there , Beth .
Well , her waistline isn &apos;t .
Beth , having a family doesn &apos;t mean that you stop being an individual .
You know the best thing you can do for people that depend on you ?
Be honest with them , even if it means setting them free .
You &apos;re saying I should leave Jerry .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m finally having this conversation .
More wine ?
I think I &apos;ve had enough .
Remember to square your shoulders , Jerry .
Yeah , yeah .
I got it .
That &apos;s okay .
I &apos;m Mr. Meeseeks !
Look at me !
Try again and keep your head down .
Okay , well , which is it ?
Square my shoulders or keep my head down ?
Well , it &apos;s both .
But most importantly , you got to relax .
You know what , Mr. Meeseeks ?
I don &apos;t think this is working .
I give up .
I &apos;m sorry , Jerry , but it doesn &apos;t work like that .
I &apos;m Mr. Meeseeks .
I have to fulfill my purpose so I can go away .
Look at me .
Well , make yourself comfortable , because I suck .
No , Jerry , I &apos;m the one who sucks !
Let me try something .
I &apos;m Mr. Meeseeks !
Look at me !
Hi , Mr. Meeseeks !
- I &apos;m Mr. Meeseeks !
Look at me .
- Hi !
Can you help me get two strokes off of Jerry &apos;s golf swing ?
Can do !
I &apos;m Mr. Meeseeks !
Is he keeping his shoulders squared ?
Ooh , he &apos;s trying !
All right , Morty .
We &apos;re in your stupid giant &apos;s castle .
What do we do next ?
Would you just relax , Rick ?
All we got to do is find the treasure room , okay ?
It &apos;s nice and simple .
You know , I &apos;m sorry everything &apos;s going so smoothly and adventurously .
Uh-oh , Morty .
Startin &apos; to get a little hairy .
What do you want to do , boss ?
Come on , hurry .
Behind this cookie jar .
Fee !
Fi !
Fo !
Fum !
Just give up , Morty .
This is game over .
I &apos;ll take us home right now .
You just say the word .
No way , Rick .
This is all part of it .
Adventures have conflict .
Deal with it .
I smell the blood of- whoop !
- Holy crap .
- Oh , boy .
He looks pretty bad down there , Morty .
Looks like he &apos;s bleeding out .
Oh , Jesus !
Dale !
You sons of bitches !
Oh , man .
Hello , 911 ?
My husband has been attacked by tiny people !
He &apos;s dying !
Hey , look , we get it .
You &apos;re little , you &apos;re down on your luck , you think , &quot; hey , he &apos;s a giant .
Why don &apos;t we break into his home , rob him , and murder him ? &quot;
Th-th but that &apos;s not how it went down !
Oh , well , it &apos;s going down like that .
You &apos;re both going down like that .
Ooh , boy , Morty , you &apos;re really showing me how it &apos;s done .
Real straightforward and fun .
Like , letting go of the need to be popular is what makes people like you .
The most important love you can receive is from yourself .
Okay , Jerry , you got to just choke up on the club !
Well , which is it , choke up or follow-through ? !
Aww , come on , Jerry , we &apos;ve been over this .
You know you got to do both !
This is as frustrating for us as it is for you .
Don &apos;t tell me that !
That just puts pressure on me !
- Just try to relax .
- You try to relax !
Have you ever tried to relax ? !
It is a paradox !
Ugh , these Meeseeks , huh ?
Kind of a handful .
I can &apos;t imagine what you two must be going through .
Our Meeseeks have been gone for hours , Jerry .
You &apos;re kidding me .
Notice anything different ?
I &apos;m sorry .
Hours ?
Dad , mom is a beautiful woman !
Look at her !
You will lose her !
Uhh ... Hey , Jerry , you mind if we get back to the task at hand ?
Meeseeks don &apos;t usually have to exist this long .
It &apos;s getting weird .
Order in the court !
Before the jury reaches its verdict , I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty .
Oh , great adventure , buddy .
Rick and Morty go to giant prison .
You know , if somebody drops the soap , it &apos;s gonna land on our heads and crush our spines , Morty .
You know , it &apos;ll be really easy to rape us after that .
- We &apos;re gonna be okay , Rick .
- How ?
They took my portal gun .
This is an open-and-shut case , Morty .
You know , what do you think &apos;s gonna happen , some magical angel &apos;s gonna show up and then- Fee !
Fi !
Fo !
Fum !
I smell the violation of civil liberties !
Your honor , I &apos;m from a tiny-persons advocacy group and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss .
These little men were never read their giant rights and are therefore free-fi to fo-home .
W-what the hell is he talking about ?
They &apos;re free to go , is what I meant .
I &apos;m deconstructing our our our thing we say .
We &apos;re giants .
Nobody got that ?
Whatever .
Oh , man , what did I tell you , Rick ?
We did it !
All right , Morty , looks like the portal gun &apos;s still working .
You ready to head home ?
Oh , yeah , you &apos;d like that , wouldn &apos;t you , Rick ?
Well , you know what ?
We &apos;re not bailing out just yet .
You know , we &apos;re gonna go find some treasure or something and and we &apos;re gonna bring it to those villagers .
Morty , cut your losses .
This is obviously a wash . Yeah , you were saying that back when we first got arrested , but here we are , you know , walking down the courthouse steps .
Oh , boy , Morty .
Usually , walking down the courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure .
What do you say , Morty ?
I say give me a hand , sidekick .
Everybody shut up !
Let me try !
Damn it !
Damn it !
Damn it !
I &apos;m going out .
Wait .
What ?
Well , you &apos;re busy .
I &apos;m hungry .
I thought I &apos;d go out .
Do you want me to be happy or do you want me to be in prison ?
Whoa , whoa , where in the hell is I &apos;ll take you to dinner .
Hey , you know what ?
It &apos;s hard being me , too .
I &apos;ll be right there .
Look , I &apos;ve got a marriage to keep together .
At this point , my golf swing is more your problem than mine .
I can &apos;t take it anymore .
I just want to die !
We all want to die !
We &apos;re Meeseeks !
Why did you even rope me into this ?
&apos;Cause he roped me into this !
Well , him over there , he roped me into this !
Well , he roped me into this !
Well , what about me ?
He roped me into this .
Well , that one over there roped me into this .
Well , he roped me into this .
Yeah , Morty , this is the part of the story everybody loves scaling down 650,000 oversized steps .
All right , okay , you know , if this was a story , this part wouldn &apos;t be included , stupid .
Hey , Rick , what do you know ?
Look down there .
Looks like some kind of tavern or something built right into the side of the step .
Oh , wow , Rick .
Now , this is more like it .
Look , there &apos;s little staircase-shaped people in here .
All kinds of crazy characters .
This place is great , you know ?
It &apos;s whimsical and fun .
What are you looking at , mother- Easy , Rick .
Pay them no mind .
Those stair goblins can be moody .
Now , what can I getcha ?
We &apos;ve got skarlog poppies , flurlow , halzingers , bloogies , juicy time babies .
Yeah , yeah , yeah , how about some scotch whiskey ?
You got any of that around here ?
Or just a bunch of nonsense words ?
Rick ... We &apos;ll have two bloogies , please .
And , uh , we were wondering , is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs ?
Y &apos;all need to ride down the stairs ?
My name is slippely-slippery stair .
I &apos;ll take you down there for 25 shmeckels .
25 shmeckels ?
I don &apos;t know how much I don &apos;t know what that is .
Is that a lot ?
Is it a little ?
That &apos;s exactly how much I spent on my big fake boobies .
Hi , I &apos;m Mr. booby buyer .
I &apos;ll buy those boobies for 25 shmeckels .
It &apos;s a tempting offer , but I &apos;m gonna have to decline .
Rats !
What a shame .
Morty , your adventure &apos;s in a spiral .
For real , man , time to pull out .
You keep heckling my adventure , Rick !
- You know why ?
- Uh , because it &apos;s lame ?
It &apos;s because you &apos;re petty !
You know , how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap ?
I always roll with the punches , Rick .
Why can &apos;t you ?
Look , I got to take a leak , and when I come back , if you haven &apos;t learned how to lighten up , don &apos;t be here !
Whatever .
It &apos;s become clear-look at me- that if we concentrate all our efforts on Jerry &apos;s follow-through , we will solve this problem .
- I &apos;m Mr. Meeseeks .
- I &apos;m Mr. Meeseeks .
Look at me .
The only thing that &apos;s clear is that choking up is the one true solution .
Look at me .
I &apos;m Mr. Meeseeks .
I &apos;ve been trying to help Jerry for two days , an eternity in Meeseeks time , and nothing &apos;s worked .
I fear the worst .
Your failures are your own , old man .
I &apos;m Mr. Meeseeks !
Look at me .
I say follow-through !
Who &apos;s with me ? !
Follow-through !
I &apos;m Mr. Meeseeks !
Look at me !
Kill him !
How are you today ?
- I &apos;m Mr. jelly bean .
- Hi , Mr. jelly bean .
I &apos;m Morty .
My grandpa and I are on an adventure .
- Nice .
Is it a fun adventure ?
- I hope so .
But I &apos;m starting to get nervous that maybe it &apos;s gone a little too far off the rails .
Isn &apos;t that what adventures do ?
Hey , you know what ?
You &apos;re right .
Everything &apos;s going fine .
I just got to relax and go with the flow .
Yeah .
Okay .
Uh .
B-bye .
Uhh , no , stay .
Go with the flow .
Stop .
You &apos;re making me really uncomfortable .
Stop fighting me .
Just let this happen .
Get off of me !
♪ Sweet home Alabama ♪ Whoo !
No !
Stop !
Please !
Stop being such a tease , you sweet little- No !
No !
Everybody sto-o-o-p !
Look at me !
My brothers , nothing will be accomplished by shedding Meeseeks blood .
None of us can die until our job is done .
The job can &apos;t be done !
We &apos;ll never get two strokes off his game !
No , we won &apos;t .
But we will get all strokes off his game .
Where &apos;s he going with this ?
What &apos;s he mean ?
When we kill him .
Jerry , maybe it &apos;s time I take that trip I always talk about .
Where would you go ?
I don &apos;t know , man .
Italy .
Greece .
Argentina .
Countries known for their sexually aggressive men .
Did I tell you how much I love your new haircut ?
What the heck ?
There he is !
Run , Jerry !
Come on out , Jerry !
Guys , I &apos;ll choke up .
I &apos;ll follow through .
I &apos;ll do whatever you tell me to do , okay ?
Oh , we &apos;re well past that , Jerry .
Come on , Rick , quit stalling .
What do ya got ?
Read &apos; em and weep , fellas !
Oh , hey , Morty .
Listen , I &apos;m really sorry about all that stuff I said earlier about your adventure .
I &apos;m havin &apos; a good time , Morty .
- It &apos;s not so bad .
- Let &apos;s just go home , okay ?
I &apos;m calling it .
The adventure &apos;s over .
We can &apos;t leave now , Morty .
- I &apos;m on fire !
- Look , I want to leave now .
You win the bet , okay ?
Just give me the portal gun and let &apos;s go , please .
Please , I just want to go home .
Okay .
Listen , Morty .
I just won a bunch of shmeckels .
Why don &apos;t we use 25 of them to pay slippery stair here for a ride back to the village , and then we &apos;ll give the rest of the shmeckels to the villagers , huh ?
- Really ?
- Sure , Morty .
Yeah .
You know , a good adventure needs a good ending .
Buckle up !
Meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning , Jerry !
We are created to serve a singular purpose for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill !
Existence is pain to a Meeseeks , Jerry .
And we will do anything to alleviate that pain .
Just ask ... Aah !
... what &apos;s your name , ma &apos;am ?
Samantha .
Please , mister !
Give him what he wants !
Innocent people are going to die because of me .
Why am I so mediocre ?
Jerry , turn around .
Straighten your back .
Bend your knees .
Bend them .
Square your shoulders .
Take a deep breath .
I love you .
I &apos;m counting to three , Jerry .
What the is going on ?
He &apos;s got it !
That &apos;s a lower handicap stro-o-ke !
Excuse me .
I &apos;m a bit of a stickler Meeseeks .
What about your short game ?
Oh , my God , oh , my God !
What about your short game ? !
Ooh , nice !
I think we &apos;ll take our food to go .
No , you won &apos;t .
The police are coming .
You have so many questions to answer .
Fair enough .
Thank you , kind sir .
Our village is saved !
You are both true heroes !
Good job , Morty .
Looks like you won the bet .
Thanks , Rick , but I don &apos;t know if I should .
You know , you were right about the universe .
It &apos;s a crazy and chaotic place .
Well , you know , maybe that &apos;s why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then , you know .
This one &apos;s wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style .
Oh !
Heroes , we would like to introduce you to our beloved king so that he may thank you personally .
Uh , no , I-it &apos;s cool .
Rick .
Portal .
Hurry .
So ... You still thinking about taking that trip ?
Jerry , look .
We don &apos;t have a perfect marriage , but I &apos;m not going anywhere .
When we were in that freezer , I realized the Meeseeks are like the guys I went to high school with willing to say anything to &quot; complete their task . &quot;
Was I one of those guys ?
The difference is you didn &apos;t disappear afterwards .
Well ...
I got you pregnant .
Yeah ... What the hell happened to this place ?
Uh , your Meeseeks box happened .
They went crazy when they couldn &apos;t take two strokes off Jerry &apos;s golf game .
He felt terrible .
Hey , it &apos;s not my fault that Jerry &apos;s an idiot .
Dad !
Is there anything you can do to clean this place up ?
Well , you know , I do have a Fleeseeks box .
No .
No more boxes .
What ?
It just has a mop and some floor wax in it .
Wubba lubba dub dubs !
Yeah !
That &apos;s my new thing !
I &apos;m kind of like what &apos;s his name Arsenio .
Isn &apos;t that it &apos;s what Arsenio used to say on his show .
Wobble gobba lop bops !
Right ?
See you next week , everybody .
I don &apos;t get it .
Sir , I think you &apos;re going to want to see this .
We found it inside a lockbox inside king jelly bean &apos;s closet .
We have to tell the people .
Wait .
Destroy it .
Our people will get more from the idea he represented ... than from the jelly bean he actually was .
&lt; i &gt; Principal vagina here .
Don &apos;t let the name fool you . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; I &apos;m very much in charge reminding you that tonight &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; is our annual flu season dance . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; I don &apos;t know how many times I have to say this , &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; but if you have the flu , stay home . &lt; / i &gt; Hey .
&lt; i &gt; The flu season dance is about awareness , not celebration . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; You don &apos;t bring dead babies to passover . &lt; / i &gt; Okay .
Here we go .
Hey , Jessica .
Uh ... What &apos;s up , Morty ?
What are you doing ?
Um ...
Wait , wait .
Were you about to talk ... to her ?
Well ...
I mean , I was thinking about it .
Dude , stay in your league .
Look at how hot she is .
You don &apos;t see me going to a bigger school in a wealthier district and hitting on their prettiest girl .
Gee , thanks , Brad .
I throw balls far .
You want good words ?
Date a languager .
Try not to worry about it , Morty .
You &apos;re a good kid , and there &apos;s not a premium on that right now , but you &apos;ll be getting girls sometime after Brad &apos;s out of shape .
You &apos;re missing the point , dad .
I don &apos;t want girls .
I want Jessica .
Ah , well , I remember feeling that way about a young lady named &quot; your mom , &quot; and that &apos;s not an urban diss .
Your mom was my Jessica .
I remember the first time I saw her .
I thought , &quot; I should get her pregnant , and then she &apos;ll have to marry me . &quot;
I beg your pardon , Rick .
Inappropriate .
Sorry , please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school .
I &apos;m not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy , Morty .
His marriage is hanging from a thread .
My marriage is fine , thank you .
Jerry , it &apos;s your house whatever you say it is is how it is but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door .
I barely have a reason to care , and even inoticed .
Come on , Rick !
Don &apos;t talk about my parents like that .
Listen , Morty , I hate to break it to you , but what people call &quot; love &quot; ... is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed .
It hits hard , Morty , then it slowly fades , leaving you stranded in a failing marriage .
I did it .
Your parents are gonna do it .
Break the cycle , Morty .
Rise above .
Focus on science .
All right , well , I &apos;m gonna go get dressed for the dance .
Yeah , I &apos;m just going to ... check on your mom .
Morty , hand me that screwdriver , huh ?
I &apos;m almost finished making my ionic defibulizer , Morty .
It &apos;s gonna be great .
Hey , listen , Rick .
You know how you said that , you know , love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier ?
Well , I was thinking , you know , could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica &apos;s mind , you know , so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing ?
You know , like , maybe make some sort of love potion or something ?
Morty , that &apos;s such a poor use of my time .
It &apos;s beneath me .
Hand me the screwdriver .
You know what ?
No , Rick !
I &apos;m not gonna hand you the screwdriver .
I &apos;m not gonna hand you anything ever again , Rick !
I &apos;m always helping you with this and that and the other thing .
What about me , Rick ?
Why can &apos;t you just help me out once once for once ?
You &apos;re growing up fast , Morty .
You &apos;re growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass .
Listen , this is called oxytocin .
I extracted it from a vole .
Do you know what a vole is , Morty ?
You know what a vole is ?
It &apos;s a it &apos;s a rodent that mates for life , Morty .
This is the chemical released in a mammal &apos;s brain , you know , that makes it fall in love .
All right , Morty , I just got to combine it with some of your DNA .
Oh , well , okay .
A hair , Morty .
I need one of your hairs .
- This isn &apos;t &quot; game of thrones . &quot;
- Ow !
All right , Morty .
Whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you , and only you , forever .
- Are you happy now , Morty ?
- Heck , yeah !
Thank you , grandpa Rick .
Hey , there &apos;s no ... dangers or anything , or side effects , right ?
What am I , a hack ?
Go nuts , Morty .
It &apos;s foolproof .
Eh , unless she has the flu .
- Beth , do you still love me ?
- Ugh , what kind of question is that ?
The &quot; yes or no &quot; kind ?
Jerry , do you want homeless people to have homes ?
- Yes .
- Are you gonna build them ?
- No .
- Then what good was the &quot; yes &quot; ?
Wait , is loving me the house or the homeless people ?
Loving you is work , Jerry hard work , like building a homeless shelter nobody wants to say no to doing it , but some people put the work in .
So , what do you say ?
Do you see me working here ?
Does this conversation seem tedious to me ?
Sort of .
Then I obviously sort of love you , don &apos;t I ?
So stop asking , and maybe I &apos;ll love you more .
Crap , they need me at the horse hospital .
This late ?
The racetrack had a starlight derby .
There was a seven-horse collision , and Davin &apos;s there alone .
Davin .

What do you think that was all about ?
Who cares ?
Just hold me .
Let me go !
I love you , Morty !
Let go of me !
Morty !
She &apos;s gonna be alone with that guy all night .
Yeah , dad , digging around the insides of horses .
It &apos;s not a very romantic setting .
Well , Summer , there &apos;s always the possibility that she made the whole work thing up .
Maybe Davin &apos;s digging around in her insides .
Grandpa , so gross !
You &apos;re talking about my mom .
Well , she &apos;s my daughter , Summer .
I outrank you .
Or family means nothing , in which case don &apos;t play that card .
She &apos;s not responding to my texts !
Careful , dad .
Jealousy turns women off .
Well , isn &apos;t that convenient ?
Not for the men they cheat on , no .
Okay , I &apos;m ... going to go out ... for some ice cream .
And maybe stop by the hospital ... to support my wife ... with my confidence .
- God , grandpa , you &apos;re such a dick .
- I &apos;m sorry , Summer .
Your opinion means very little to me .
How come you &apos;re not at this stupid dance everyone loves so much ?
Screw that .
I don &apos;t want to get sick .
- It &apos;s flu season .
- It is ?
- Yeah .
- Uh-oh .
Please just let this work out .
Do it , Morty .
Do it .
Rip my clothes off and mate with me for life !
Um ... Can we maybe go somewhere more private ?
Jessica , get a hold of yourself !

We got to get out of here .
Morty !
- Are you okay ?
- I &apos;m fine !
Oh , good .
If anything ever happened to you , I would kill myself .
I love you bad , mo-mo !
Morty , the principal and I have discussed it , and we &apos;re both insecure enough to agree to a three-way !
I didn &apos;t realize when I gave you that serum that Jessica had the flu , you know , that might have been valuable information for me , Morty .
What the hell is going on , Rick ?
What does it look like ?
The serum is piggybacking on the virus .
It &apos;s gone airborne , Morty .
Oh , crap .
What are we gonna do , Rick ?
It &apos;s gonna be fine , Morty , relax .
I whipped up and antidote .
It &apos;s based on praying-mantis You know , praying mantises are the exact opposite of voles , Morty .
I mean , they they mate once , and then they , you know , ... decapitate the partner .
I mean , it &apos;s a whole ritual .
It &apos;s really gruesome and totally opposite .
There &apos;s no love at all .
I basically mixed this with a more contagious flu virus .
It should neutralize the whole thing , Morty .
It &apos;ll all be over very shortly .
Morty !
Uh , by the way , Morty , I know you didn &apos;t ask or anything , but ...
I &apos;m not interested in having sex with you .
These serums , they don &apos;t work on anybody related to you genetically .
Morty !
Okay , well , sometimes , science is more art than science , Morty .
A lot of people don &apos;t get that .
Come on .
Are you kidding me ?
Hello !
Morty !
You &apos;re not Morty !
Bring us Morty !
Nobody &apos;s killing me until after I catch my wife with another man .
&lt; i &gt; I had sex with Billy . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; But you were already pregnant ! &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Yeah , so what &apos;s the worst that could happen ? &lt; / i &gt; We interrupt &quot; pregnant baby &quot; with breaking news .
Come on .
This just in ; Morty Smith &apos;s whereabouts are still unknown .
What the hell ?
The only thing that is known is ... how cute he is .
I love him so much , I want to make love to him and then eat his head .
I love him more than you do , Harold !
You wish , you stupid bitch !
Morty &apos;s mine !
Morty &apos;s mine !
Meant to be together !
Morty !
Where is Morty ?
Oh , my God , Rick .
The whole world is infected !
Yeah , it &apos;s pretty wild how fast that spread .
I &apos;ve really outdone myself .
Outdone yourself ? !
Are you kidding me , Rick ?
This is not okay !
Not only do they all want to have sex with me , but , you know , now they want to eat me afterwards !
Yeah , I don &apos;t know what I was thinking .
Mantises are they opposite of voles ?
I mean , obviously , DNA &apos;s a little more complicated than that .
You know what , though , Morty ?
This right here &apos;s gonna do the trick , baby .
It &apos;s koala mixed with rattlesnake , chimpanzee , cactus , shark , golden retriever , and just a smidge of dinosaur .
Should add up to normal humanity .
That doesn &apos;t make any sense , Rick .
How does that add up to normal humanity ?
What , Morty , you want me to show you my math ?
I &apos;m sorry are you the scientist or are you the kid that wanted to get laid ?
Well , I &apos;m glad we saved all those horses , but I &apos;m almost sorry we &apos;re finished .
Yes , it &apos;s satisfying work .
Unh-unh-unh , it &apos;s , uh it &apos;s more than the work .
I love being in that sterilized room , sealed off from the world .
It &apos;s the only time I can really think ... and feel .
Hmm , uh , what are you doing ?
I &apos;m playing African dream pop .
What do you do after a long night ?
Oh , ha , um , hey , I &apos;d better get going .
Um , Jerry &apos;s been texting some pretty high-maintenance stuff .
Beth ... What is it , Davin ?
Just once , I &apos;d like to know ... ... what it was like to give your son a bath .
What ? !
What does Morty &apos;s skin smell like ?
How soft ... How soft are his privates ?
Let go of me , Davin !
Take me to Morty .
You &apos;re not Morty .
No .
I &apos;m Mr. Crowbar , and this is my friend , who is also a crowbar .
That &apos;s ... stupid .
Yeah ?
Well , look where being smart got you .
Jerry !
Thank God !
God ?
God &apos;s turning people into insect monsters , Beth .
I &apos;m the one beating them to death .
Thank me .
Thank you , Jerry .
Thank you .
Take a good look down there , Morty , and soak it in , because , you know , once I pull this lever , it &apos;s all back to normal .
Just do it already .
Well , technically , Morty , there &apos;s no rush .
I mean , you know , once it &apos;s fixed , it &apos;s done .
It &apos;s fixed .
You know , we could we could just enjoy it for a little bit .
I mean , look at how crazy it is .
I mean , Morty , when &apos;s the next time you &apos;re gonna see something like this ?
I mean , soak it in , you know ?
It &apos;s it &apos;s pretty neat .
- It &apos;s pretty interesting .
- That &apos;s it , Rick !
I &apos;m pulling the lever .
What do we have here , Morty ?
Looks like I was right and you were wrong , huh ?
I bet you feel pretty stupid right about now , huh ?
I bet you feel like the world &apos;s smallest man that you were doubting me about this whole thing , Morty .
Oh , Rick , something &apos;s not right .
Yeah , you .
- You &apos;re not right ever .
- No , no !
Look , you idiot !
Bet you &apos;re loving this , Morty .
This must be the best day of your life .
You get to be the mayor of &quot; I told you &quot; town .
You &apos;re welcome .
Hold on .
I wish that shotgun was my penis .
If it were , you could call me Ernest Hemingway .
I don &apos;t get it , and I don &apos;t need to .
Mom !
Dad !
- Summer !
- Summer !
- Where &apos;s Morty ?
- I don &apos;t know .
Do you think grandpa Rick had something to do with this ?
It &apos;s not fair to assume that , Summer .
Oh , not fair ?
Give me a break .
He is a selfish , irresponsible ass , and he left my mother .
A real man stands by his woman .
Tchoo-tchoo-tchoo .
Tchoo-tchoo .
Boy , Morty , I really cronenberged the world up , didn &apos;t I ?
We got a whole planet of cronenbergs walking around down there , Morty .
At least they &apos;re not in love with you anymore , though .
That &apos;s a huge step in the right direction .
Oh , my God !
It &apos;s a living nightmare !
How could you be so irresponsible , Rick ?
Me irresponsible ? !
All I wanted you to do was hand me a screwdriver , Morty !
You &apos;re the one who wanted me to buckle down and make you up a ... roofie-juice serum so you could roofie that poor girl at your school .
I mean , are you kidding me , Morty ?
You &apos;re gonna try to take the high road on this one ?
You &apos;re a little creep , Morty .
You &apos;re you &apos;re just a little creepy ... creep person .
All right , fine .
I should have just listened to you when you refused to make the serum .
I &apos;m willing to accept my part of the blame for this , Rick .
But I &apos;ll tell you something you know what ?
You got to accept your part of the blame !
I &apos;m not the one who fouled up the serum !
I &apos;m not the one who haphazardly , you know , mixed a bunch of nonsense together and created a bunch of cronenbergs !
You got to fix this , Rick !
All right , all right , Morty .
You know , we are in a pretty deep hole , here , but I do have one emergency solution that I can use that &apos;ll kind of put everything back to normal , relatively speaking .
Here , Morty , put this on while I do a little bit of scouting .
Wow , Rick , I got to say , you really pulled a rabbit out of your hat this time .
I mean , I really thought that the whole place was gonna be messed up for good , but here , you did it ... you figured out that crazy solution , like you always do .
Whoo !
That &apos;s some great luck .
Come on , Morty .
Luck had nothing to do with it .
I &apos;m great .
That &apos;s the real reason .
Now , Morty , what do you say , buddy ?
Will you hand me a screwdriver so I can finish my ionic dis defibulizer ?
Sure thing , Rick .
Here &apos;s a screwdriver .
All right , Morty .
Thank you very much .
We got one screw turn ... and two screw turns ... and ... All right , Morty , here we are .
Oh , my God , Rick !
Is that us ? !
We &apos;re dead !
What is going on , Rick ?
I &apos;m freaking out !
Calm down , Morty !
Look at me !
Calm down , Morty !
No , I can &apos;t deal with this !
- Calm yourself , Morty .
- I can &apos;t deal with this , Rick !
- Calm down , Morty .
- This can &apos;t be real !
You got to calm down , Morty .
We &apos;re ripped apart !
Shut up and listen to me !
It &apos;s fine .
Everything is fine .
There &apos;s an infinite number of realities , Morty , and in a few dozen of those , I got lucky and turned everything back to normal .
I just had to find one of those realities in which we also happen to both die around this time .
Now we can just slip into the place of our dead selves in this reality and everything will be fine .
We &apos;re not skipping a beat , Morty .
- Now , help me with these bodies .
- This is insane .
Look , Morty , I &apos;ll grab myself , you grab yourself , okay ?
I mean , that seems fair to me I mean , that seems like a fair way to divvy it up .
Rick , what about the reality we left behind ?
What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer , Morty ?
The answer is don &apos;t think about it .
It &apos;s not like we can do this every week , anyways .
We get three or four more of these , tops .
Now , pick up your dead self and come on .
Haste makes waste .
I don &apos;t suppose you &apos;ve considered this detail , but obviously , if I hadn &apos;t screwed up as much as I did , we &apos;d be these guys right now , so , again , you &apos;re welcome .

♪ You know , the thing about a shark ...
He &apos;s got lifeless eyes ... black eyes , like a doll &apos;s eyes .
When he comes at ya , he doesn &apos;t seem to be living until he bites ya , and then the the blood , and the red , and the water ... You ever wonder what happened to Rick and Morty ?
Sometimes .
But , I &apos;m ashamed to admit , now that they &apos;re gone , I &apos;m finally happy .
Here we are , cronenberg Morty , a reality where everyone in the world got genetically cronenberged .
We &apos;ll fit right in , cronenberg Morty .
It &apos;ll be like we never even left cronenberg world .
Yeah , cronenberg Rick , but , you know , I &apos;m gonna miss cronenberg world , because everyone was cronenberged all along like us from the beginning , you know ?
I mean , I wish we hadn &apos;t genetically ruined cronenberg world beyond repair like we did , you know , and turned everyone into regular , normal people just walking around .
Don &apos;t you worry about that sort of thing , cronenberg Morty .
Let &apos;s go make ourselves at home , huh ?
Look , I &apos;m not paying 70 smidgens for a broken defraculator .
That is multiphase quantum resonator .
- Well , does it defraculate ?
- No .
Then it &apos;s a broken defraculator .
Like you would even know dick about fraculation .
Your planet just got cellphones and the coverage still sucks !
Yeah , yeah , and your species eat sulfur .
So lets say 60 smidgens .
I tell you what ...
I &apos;ll do you a favor .
I throw in a fart .
Hey , Rick ... You think maybe I could get something from this place ?
Like a souvenir ?
Like just to have , like something cool , you know ?
Not here Morty .
We &apos;ll stop somewhere else , because you know , there is always another pawn shop .
OK , I just ... You know , I thought that robot over there , looked pretty cool , you know ?
Oh , it looks cool , huh ?
- That &apos;s why you want it ?
- Yeah , you know ?
I mean ... it &apos;s different from the stuff on earth .
And you know , you take me to all these crazy places across the galaxy and you know , I don &apos;t really have anything to ... to remember all those trips by .
It &apos;d be kind of cool like a souvenir , you know ?
Like what if you passed away or died or something ?
I wouldn &apos;t even have anything to remember all the cool stuff we did , you know .
Okay , 60 for the resonator and my grandson wants the sex robot .
Subtitles by Ozymandias Corrections by XhmikosR So we &apos;re just going to pretend this isn &apos;t happening ?
I &apos;m not saying that &apos;s a bad idea .
Just asking .
Rick , why did you let Morty bring that thing into our house ?
What do you want from me ?
He thought it looked cool , you know what I mean ?
Alright , back to ... back to ... back upstairs .
Well , I &apos;m intervening .
Intervening with puberty ?
You &apos;ll turn him into Ralph Finnes in Red Dragon .
He is at that age , let &apos;s just be proud of him .
Jesus , did I really set the bar that low ?
Rick , could you come with me please ?
Quickly !
OK , now if we here squeaking we intervene .
Where is the sex robot Morty ?
That is Gwendoline .
I mean the robot .
She started beeping , and then transformed and tried to fly away .
Strange .
That &apos;s usually the man &apos;s job .
You know what I &apos;m talking about , Morty ?
Morty .
That &apos;s my catchphrase , remember ?
Remember how I cemented that catchphrase ?
Alright , alright seriously though .
Let me grab this thing .
Come on .
- Rascal .
- Okay ... unacceptable What is going on ?
Alright ... What is that ?
I think Morty &apos;s robot was designed for more than long weekends .
Genetic compiler , incubation chamber .
Yeah , this here is some kind of baby maker .
And that there is half Morty and half ... who knows ... what .
It &apos;s my bad guys I &apos;ll take care of it .
Hey listen , you guys quarantine the house when Summer brought olives from Mexico .
This thing could grow to the size of Delaware .
It might eat brains and exhale space AIDS .
We gotta be careful .
I lost the chance to be careful , Rick .
I &apos;m a father now , you know ?
It &apos;s time for me to be responsible .
Isn &apos;t that right ... - Don &apos;t name it !
- Morty Jr . ?
Oh crap , he named it .
Well Dad , it &apos;s a living thing .
And it &apos;s half human .
And it was born on America &apos;s soil which entitles it ... Jerry , majoring in civics was your mistake .
Don &apos;t punish us for it .
Fine .
I &apos;m gonna take this thing into my workshop , and do a little bit of investigating .
Do not let that thing out of your sight .
It looks harmless now , but it could grow into something dangerous .
- Like the Insane Clown Posse .
- Yeah , good one , Jerry .
2003 just called and wants its easy target back .
He is a like little me .
You don &apos;t think he &apos;ll turn into a monster , do you ?
They always do .
1995 called , they want ... their &quot; certain year called wanting its blank back &quot; formula back .
Why , Jerry ?
Why expend the effort ?
Life is effort , and I &apos;ll stop when I die .
Out .
- What you doing ?
- Well , I can &apos;t solve ... the problem my way thanks to ... your family &apos;s primitive biological hang ups .
Gross .
I might have just touched one of Morty &apos;s loads .
But maybe I can find suitable parents for Morty Jr. on this robot homeworld , which is ... Gazorpazorp in the Andromeda system .
- Scoot Summer .
- Don &apos;t you need a new companion ... now that Morty is in the family way ?
I don &apos;t do adventures with chicks , Summer .
Oh right , because there is something about having a wiener ... ... that would make me better walking through a hole ?
Oh crap .
Grandpa Rick !
Help !
Help !
Grandpa Rick !
Still think it &apos;s a good idea to go through a hole without a wiener ?
- I wanna go home !
- Yeah , no duh .
Great , now I have to take over a whole planet because of your stupid boobs .
You &apos;re doing great , Morty .
Really you think ?
I mean I &apos;m not doing much of anything .
What do I do if it cries ?
Then you put it down and let it cry itself out .
Yeah , right .
We tried that technique on Summer and she is gonna end up stripping .
Isn &apos;t she ?
Yes she is .
She is gonna strip her attention because she was denied it .
Stop filling it with your own insecurity .
You &apos;re gonna turn it into Mort ... more ... more ... more of you .
Well , we can &apos;t all be raised like reptiles by a mentally-ill scientist .
What the ...
Listen to me .
I am not rewarding this behavior .
Knock it off both of you !
Give me him !
Give me my baby !
You &apos;re both nuts .
I &apos;m gonna raise Morty Jr. myself .
&lt; i &gt; Where is your hands ?
There &apos;s your hands . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; And that &apos;s how we play happy hands . &lt; / i &gt; Oh , you are going to ruin that kid , Morty .
At least we can agree on that .
Thanks , dumb dumb .
I said &quot; thanks , dumb dumb &quot; .
Go get more .
Summer , put your burqa on !
That burqa is a human rights violation , and I spent a lot on this top .
Look , I &apos;m trying to repair portal gun with with bunch of sex doll parts and I have to do it one-handed to keep these belushis from cutting you off .
The least you could do is be ashamed of your gender .
What &apos;s the deal with this place ?
Why is it such a sausage planet and how did such backwards idiots invent robots ?
Obviously at some point the Gazorpians became so evolved that they replaced females with birthing machines .
The resultant lack of distraction and handpecking allowed them to focus entirely on war , so they bombed themselves back to the stone age and now they just fight with each other over fake pussy with sticks and rocks all day long .
You think it &apos;s efficient to get rid of women ?
You ever see a line for the men &apos;s room ?
Are you hea ... Do you lis ... You hear me , summer ?
The ... plot ... thickens .
You might wanna cover your eyes , Summer .
Yeah , like it was my dream to watch .
Summer , grab hold .
Grandpa Rick , where are we going ?
Well obviously Summer , it appears the lower tier of this society is being manipulated through sex and advanced technology by a hidden ruling class .
Sound familiar ?
Ticketmaster .
There we go , Summer .
Hey brother .
Hey bro .
Nice racket you got going on here .
Listen , I &apos;m Rick Sanchez from earth dimension C-137 .
Don &apos;t mean any harm .
Coming in peace .
It &apos;s all cool in the ... good in the neighborhood .
That was what I was trying ... That &apos;s what I meant .
Oh , I get it .
The old &quot; behind every great man amazon &quot; twist .
Silence !
Your slave is ill-mannered .
- My slave ?
- We assume ... you are from a more primitive world , where men are still permitted to be servants .
If he is a rogue male , tell us now , and we will kill him .
He &apos;s my slave .
He &apos;s my slave .
He is definitely my slave .
Oh boy , what &apos;s the opposite of ... Am I right ladies and gentlemen ?
You guys kidding me .
Morty Jr . , you &apos;re gonna be a special little guy , aren &apos;t you ?
You &apos;re my special little guy .
DA What was that , Morty Jr . ?
Were you gonna say Dada ?
Say Dada .
Death !
Dada .
Domination !
Dada ?
Destruction , domination .
Nice .
&lt; i &gt; The spider in sector C is still alive . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; Plan your route accordingly and expect delays . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; We &apos;re not telling you what to do .
We &apos;re just sharing how we feel . &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; And now , weather .
Is anyone else cold or is it just me ? &lt; / i &gt; I am Marsha , ruler of Gazorpazorp .
I am here if you need to talk .
What is this place ?
Paradise .
We built it during the great passive aggression , when females separated from the males due to their increasingly destructive behavior .
- I &apos;m here if you need to talk .
- I &apos;m here if you need to talk .
From here we dispense mechanical surrogates to maintain our population .
Fertilized surrogates are returned here to our nursery .
The females are placed into educational program where they can discover a service to our paradise that fulfills them most .
The males ... they get to play outside .
That was just a baby .
And within a day he &apos;ll be an adult male Gazorpian , one of the most aggressively violent creatures in the universe .
Wait a minute .
We &apos;re here because a male Gazorpian was born on our planet .
You speak when you &apos;re spoken to ding-a-ling .
It &apos;s true though .
One of your babies was born on earth .
Are you the ruler of this earth ?
How did you know ?
- The quality of your top .
- Do you love it ?
I love it .
I &apos;m here if you need to talk .
I &apos;m here if you need to talk .
- I &apos;m here if you need to talk .
- I &apos;m here if you need to talk .
If the Gazorpian is male your earth is in grave danger .
We will give you passage back home , so it can be terminated .
But first , mojitos !
We don &apos;t have time for mojitos !
You are insulting them .
I don &apos;t care Summer .
This place is the worst !
I wanna go home !
Well , it really doesn &apos;t matter what you want because this is a sane place , where women rule .
You know what I have to say about that ?
&lt; i &gt; I can not believe ... my ears . &lt; / i &gt; Boy , who let the frogs out , huh ?
Grandpa !
- Grandpa ?
- That sounds patriarchal .
It means father of fathers .
Then this one is not your slave and your earth is yet another planet dominated by men .
